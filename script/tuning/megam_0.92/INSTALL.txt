MegaM (https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/megam/index.html) is a Model Optimization Package based on
maximum entropy models. It is used in lambda parameter tuning scripts for the translation system decoder.

MegaM is written using Ocam programming language and is a third party tool included in our distribution,
version 0.92 downloaded from http://hal3.name/megam/megam_src.tgz, for the sake of completeness. Another
reason is that the tool's last version 0.92 was released in 2007 so we do not want to risk the chance of
the tool being extinct.

Further we provide some installation instructions for the MegaM on Linux and Max OS. This process can
be tricky, so here is the Google group where some of the possible installation issues are discussed:

Below we present the installation steps proven to work in ours machine set-up.

Note that, to simplify the building process, we have modified the project's original Makefile presented as
Makefile.original with the changes listed in the patch file, known as Makefile.patch.

Installation steps for Linux and Max OS X platforms are listed below, the latter were successfully tested
on CentOS 6.8 and OS X EI Capitan version 10.11.6 respectively. Alternatives are possible but were not
considered. For example on different platforms, installing Ocaml can be possible via several alternative
sources, as described here: http://www.ocaml.org/docs/install.html

1. Download and install the latest Ocam compiler.
   1.1. Linux: Downloaded and installed from sources (requires root rights).
        Note 1: The compiler installed via yum on CentOS may fail to compile the code.
        Note 2: The Ocam version we worked with is the latest known: v4.04 downloadable from:
           http://www.ocaml.org/releases/4.04.html
   1.2 Max OS X: Install Ocam via HomeBrew (http://brew.sh/):
      1.2.1 Install HomeBrew via:
         $sudo /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
      1.2.2 Install Ocam via HomeBrew:
         $brew install ocaml
   In both cases, Linux and Mac OS, the Ocaml is to be installed into:
      ls /usr/local/lib/ocaml
   If it is installed into some other location then the Makefile of MegaM is to be modified, see point 3.
2. Move to the MegaM folder and build the project
   $ cd ${REMEDI_HOME}/scripts/tuning/megam_0.92
   $ make
3. In case the Ocaml is not present at its expected location: '/usr/local/lib/ocaml',
   modify the OCAML_HOME variable within the Makefile to point to the right directory.
