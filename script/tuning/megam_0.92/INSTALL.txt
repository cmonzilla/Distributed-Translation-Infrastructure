How to install MegaM (https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/megam/index.html) on Mac OS and or Linux system:
Mega M is a Model Optimization Package based on maximum entropy models. It is used in lambda parameter
tuning scripts for the translation system decoder.

Installing MegaM on Mac OS X can be tricky, so here is the Google group where possible installation
issues are discussed: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/nltk-users/loKBj0eCgZs
Below we present the installation steps proven to work in ours machine set-up.

1. Download and install the latest ocam compiler.
   1.1. Linux (CentOS 6.8) we downloaded and installed from sources.
        The compiler installed via yum could not compile the code.
        The Ocam version we tested it with was 4.04:
           http://www.ocaml.org/releases/4.04.html
   1.2 Max OS X we installed Ocam via HomeBrew (http://brew.sh/):
      1.2.1 Install HomeBrew via:
         sudo /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
      1.2.2 Install Ocam via HomeBrew:
         brew install ocaml
   In both cases the ocaml is to be installed into:
      ls /usr/local/lib/ocaml
   If it is installed in some other location then the Makefile of MegaM is to be modified, see point 3.
2. Download the MegaM source code, we used version 0.92 from:
   http://hal3.name/megam/megam_src.tgz
3. Patch the makefile of the MegaM by the Makefile patch we created
    $ cd megam_0.92
    $ patch < ${Project}/scripts/tuning/megam_0.92/Makefile.patch
    $ make
4. In case the ocaml is not installed into '/usr/local/lib/ocaml' but is located elsewhere,
   modify the OCAML_HOME variable within the Makefile to point to the right directory.
