abstract     = {<p>We review developments in the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit (SRILM) since
                2002, when a previous paper on SRILM was published. These developments include
                measures to make training from large data sets more efficient, to implement
                additional language modeling techniques (such as for adaptation and smoothing),
                and for client/server operation. In addition, the functionality for lattice
                processing has been greatly expanded. We also highlight several external
                contributions and notable applications of the toolkit, and assess SRILMâ€™s impact
                on the research community.</p>},
