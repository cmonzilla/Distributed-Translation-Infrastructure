abstract     = {<p>Pairing functions allow two-dimensional data to be compressed into one dimension,
                and they play important roles in the arrangement of data for exhaustive searches and
                other applications. Unfortunately, most well-known pairing functions have undesirable
                properties that make them difficult to use in practical circumstances. We propose a
                certain pairing function that possesses some particularly elegant properties. </p>},
