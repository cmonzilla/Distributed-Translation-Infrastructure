<seg id="2085"> at this matter should the sporting spirit ailment be investigated. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> &quot;the sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that, through these actions not at risk, because it was not aggressive game. </seg>

<seg id="2088"> the paradox of activity of the players of the real madrid is that they are not correspond to what we normally, among falschspiel &apos; or regelumgehung understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly to liberate a sanction to avoid but they should, as striking as possible from referee punished. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> the players waited and arrested the sanction joyfully. </seg>

<seg id="2096"> after this, not against the sporting spirit, which also strategic decisions, from the rules maximum benefit. address. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> , in this case, wanted the players no sanction circumvent (the would actually be a clear case of regelumgehung), they wanted to vote, when this. </seg>
