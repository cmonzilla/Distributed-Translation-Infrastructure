<finished>: it is so widespread that they form part of the ethos , - unwritten , but in this sport following rules - ) . 
<finished>: debate about the case that a team of the club real madrid ( the anthem generosity and honour and other occasions its players for similar incidents ) , and dramatisierung mourinho , an episode a more its long history as theatralischer " and provocative technician .

<finished>: , another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the gambler an unjustified benefit from the gegenteam . , also did not happen . - 
<finished>: the paradox of activity of players of real madrid is , that it does not correspond to what we normally falschspiel " or regelumgehung understand , because bypassing the rule , not secretly to liberate a sanction , but as possible from referee punished . conspicuous " ' under 
<finished>: the players waited and arrested the sanction joyfully , 
<finished>: another issue is what kind 's advantage ! the , from the deliberate fouls - . 
<finished>: here should be emphasised that the rival , neither in a worse situation been benefits for the feigned erheischt , because the obvious result of this action was that that 's own team with players discussing without anybody . ) less a game 
<finished>: it is not beneficial strategy for the next because the club , does not ' these players . 
<finished>: the benefit is obviously that players , the next spielphase of champions league maps that its participation in a future could threaten circumstances . a game ' without

<finished>: that is not as clear , whether it is really an advantage . 
<finished>: this action not against the sporting spirit , strategic decisions to the provisions maximum benefits . , address , after all 
<finished>: , in that case the players no sanction this would really be a clear case of regelumgehung ) , they , did , when it , this . adopt , but rather " ( , bypass , wanted 
<finished>: they took a strategic decision , without a penalty evade or , at its generalities . 
<finished>: , although the border between imagination and regelumgebung blurred is , i believe that this matter a clear , case of intuition . 
<finished>: i have the impression that the controversy as a result of two factors arose : because two selbstausschlüsse and because of the way the without regelübertragung ! 
<finished>: the damage that the principles of the sport by these actions caused is less ethical , rather than aesthetic .

<finished>: rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies 
<finished>: ! the rtbf wikileaks has a twofold . 
<finished>: on one side , it has a scandal , which is a scandal in sinner hypocrisy 's beziehunge between states , 's citizens and the press . turns apparent a scandal 
<finished>: , are on the other side " they profound changes at international level , and gives a foretaste by recession dominated . announces 
<finished>: but we in the right order . 
<finished>: the first aspect of wikileaks is the confirmation of the fact that each of a secret service airline act ( nation ) exclusively from press cuttings . any yet 
<finished>: " exceptional " , , american revelations about the sexual mores , nothing more than that for months , in any journal , to read ( except , whose owners berlusconi is ) and this alarming karikaturierte gaddafi bot kabarettkünstlern long time agent , for her sketche ! a profile got any anyhow , x accuse berlusconi 
<finished>: the rule , according to which the already is essential for the dynamism of the intelligence agencies , and not only this century , consist - bringing news on a secret 
<finished>: if in a library esotherischen publications , you will see ( the one on the grail , the mystery " of rennes - le - chateau " that templer rosenkreuzler accurately reiterated what already in previous plants . " ) , and the bill every " themselves , 
<finished>: this is not , therefore , that the author occult texts never ( yet , therefore , that , he would know where to news about the non - ) but because those who okkultismus nothing unlike the believe what you already know and confirmed what it already have learnt . " , and 's address itself , could exist , to find , can researches and publish , alone 
<finished>: this is also the erfolgsmechanismus " of dan brown . 
<finished>: also the secret files " . 
<finished>: the informant is a bad ' and lazy ( or in limited intellect ) is also the head of the intelligence service ( could otherwise whatever , editor libération ) , the " only true , and what he . " as , as " he 
<finished>: the top secret , information on berlusconi , the american embassy in a rome staatsdezernat , about the same as those newsweek already a week earlier publicised . adeptly " the 
<finished>: so why was a notice the revelations these dossiers ? 
<finished>: on one side , what each person has knows , and that the embassies , at least since the end of the second world war and since leaders , or a plane can dinner - its diplomatic and have lost with some small classed ' in spionagezentren . , except a function ' may be mutually call educated according 
<finished>: any viewer from ermittlungsfilmen knows this very closely , and it is not for hypocrisy , so doing it to ignore . 
<finished>: : the fact it publicly again , injured , the task of hypocrisy and the american diplomacy in a bad light . , but 
<finished>: in second : the idea that a hackers geheimsten secrets most powerful country in the world phone " can , carries the considerable blow against the prestige staatsdezernats ! " ' & ! the dozen random 
<finished>: in addition , the scandal less the casualties , " " in trouble . executioner , rather than

<finished>: but if we , today , that even the secret krypten 's power do not control a hackers can does the kontrollgang unilaterally , to be zirkelförmig ! , directed " to escape from expires am 's eye 
<finished>: every citizen , but everyone , or at least the hacker avenger by many citizens - can the secrets of power in . " as acquired ' a controlled 's power 
<finished>: how can , however , is no longer able , their own secrets alive ! 
<finished>: georg simmel said that a real mystery an empty secret is ( and an empty mystery can never be unveiled ) ; it is also true that any informed about character berlusconi " or merkel basically a mystery , free of geheimis as there is the public sphere ; but in wikileaks 's secrets hillary clinton secrets , have them means , any on power . an empty $ disclose of surrenders " , and admittedly 
<finished>: wikileaks has neither sarkozy were still merkel , injustice , however clinton and obama . 
<finished>: what are the consequences of this snub , , a such huge ? ' power caused 
<finished>: it is obvious that the states in future , no reserved information , online - the would 's street corner angeklebten posting . ' 
<finished>: but it is also clear that the technology is hoped confidential , reports on phone keep secret . frustrated 
<finished>: is nothing simpler than find out whether and when a head a aeroplane , a his colleagues contacted ! 's 
<finished>: how could , future , private , and only for certain ears , certain maintain relations ? 
<finished>: i know very well for my moment following science fiction " and romanhaft sounds , but i am compelled me the regierungsagenten , are secretive way , and score and uncontrollable marschrouten warms their communications anywhere unlike in bare , and moreover , the few written information they have schuhabsatz verbergend ! varied viewpoints erase , and " to discern " in forecasting 
<finished>: , the information in a single copy in locked drawers be stored : basically spionageversuch less successful when wikileaks . watergate did $ 
<finished>: i had the opportunity to write the technology , nowadays , like a cancer , , ( namely backwards . 
<finished>: a century after the wireless telegraf communicating revolutionised , asked assignments , the internet telegrafen ( telephone wire ! ' ) ' a

<finished>: 's trains in three hours by rome to milan , while by plane , including the switching half hours . " we continues 
<finished>: it is therefore not abnormally that politics and communications " on car and horse in return . 
<finished>: a final observation . 
<finished>: in earlier times the press , understand , for secrets between the embassies forged , an attempted 
<finished>: now the messages confidential information by the press . 
<finished>: climate - as france 's own finanzversprechen schönredet 
<finished>: a year after the copenhagen agreement is the time , compliance with the rapidly financing pledge ( also ' almost ' or premature ) to examine developing countries have been implemented . finance beginning resolved 
<finished>: are already the rough , french schönredereien discovered . 
<finished>: with the copenhagen treaty developing countries , obliged thirty billion - dollar between 2010 and 2012 . 
<finished>: , the eu has billion , over three years , promised , france 1.26 billion euros ( d . h . 420 million per year ) , and , second , that 
<finished>: when opening the cop16 , the eu has been its partners from the fact almost start - finance detailgetreuer vorgehensbericht its member states , press conference , great nebenevents broschürenverteilung ! " , and " a convincing , about its commitment , bore all 
<finished>: the operation is transparency and degrees , for their intrinsic value appreciated : the developing countries and the civil society would like to see all developed countries , the same on the same präzisionsniveau . a noteworthy 
<finished>: ) the eu announced in 2010 billion - euro , have what they the right way to respektbezollung its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012 . burst , 
<finished>: but if you detail eyes , are things are slightly more complicated . 
<finished>: this money should according to the copenhagen treaty ' new and additional ' , to ensure that an additional - use , without impairing 's public development aid . 
<finished>: , unfortunately there are no consensus on what ' new and additional ' means . 
<finished>: whereas the eu - commission a harmonisation had proposed certain , including france , the procedure blocked . member states 
<finished>: choosing today everyone benchmark in , best . 
<finished>: the eu commission has , for example a benchmark of 2009 ‘cohesion’ : the international finance are retained , and gives the funding of ' almost - start ' on for three years , 150 million . about those who " for 
<finished>: other countries have a similar benchmarks , either in respect year or , about conditions , level of public development aid elected . 
<finished>: in return , france was of the opinion that the new projects ' of 2010 ' new and additional " . 's finance " , 
<finished>: in other words : there is no benchmarks 's expenditure of previous year or at global level in public development aid . 
<finished>: specifically , can the support developing countries remain stable ( or also decrease ) - france its commitment to the " new and additional " , finance . , french total 
<finished>: , another , decisive element is the breakdown in donations and loans . 
<finished>: there is , no , and everyone elects its rechenmodus ! ' rule 
<finished>: some , such as france for example , borrowed being as equivalent at donated being ! ) 
<finished>: this is apparently be difficult acceptable that the effort is not comparable " . 
<finished>: if the use of loans for certain profitable investment ( , often emissionseindämmung projects to be justified , it is deceptively the euro to known as the equivalent , for a hijacked . also , only the cost of loan for kapitalgeberland ( d . h . the equivalent of an interest rate ' ) . counted ' as ' commitment ' , the ' euro donated , present ' ) , technology are based actually benefiting 's 
<finished>: but france did nothing in a different sense than , the following consideration : it ' " his commitment of million euro % 389 , eight million euros ) and 8.5 % 36.1 million euro ) - see eu document to convince themselves ! ' donates " ( 91 . it , loans 420 , respected 
<finished>: france is the only country in the eu that loans in a great extent . 
<finished>: germany 0.46 % , while denmark , the netherlands or slovakia ( among other things ) : its commitment to 100 % by donations . 
<finished>: in other words , if the overwhelming majority 's european union 1€ to fulfil their obligations , gives france 10 cents and understands , including a comparable . disbursed 
<finished>: fine hokuspokus ! 
<finished>: france his almost - start financing with a double cheating : a part , with an weiterentwicklkung action over time and partly from reality of financial support . breast , 
<finished>: , france to think that there 420 million ' new and additional " , million in accordance with its , promise has spent and saves 36.1 million euro . ' , " there , will succeed 
<finished>: the manipulation of the finance ministry ( da , it appears that it bercy , which carried a negative effect ; eu ( why are driving , the other the donation if it ? ) and then in the negotiations , as the developing countries not completely deceived . . lend is enough to abandon member states " , internally , double ' ) arbitration 
<finished>: the chapter of finance just a small at relatively short time compared to the discussions on the climate . " to a complete premature 
<finished>: but it could the drop too far in 's immense machinery of the unfccc ! 
<finished>: , we hope this will not be the case . 
<finished>: as it , it is essential lesson from this first year of premature finance learn . ' own ! 
<finished>: france could a change in verbuchungsart for the years 2011 and 2012 announce , and in a spirit of respect , for his obligations and countervailing justice with the other countries of the european . 's ' line , at first 
<finished>: , but mainly france could the discussions on the long term finance forward ( an another topic ) : " we can escape the question of verrechenbarkeit ' or verbuchungsart 's , loans , not . also currently decisive and a dispute 
<finished>: france could alter its position so that – just advanced 's , as the other is ! disputes 
<finished>: , hope on the new environment minister kosciusko - morizet next week in cancun . ! - based
