<finished>: what you are doing , the čssd ? the czech social democrats in prague know neither voldemort , nor the ' konditorei should " . 
<finished>: the new aldermen in the capital , from the ranks of the čssd certain overcome old - new colleagues from the ods in prague council and in the stadtvertretung at all able to understand their language , in order to be clear . 
<finished>: the newspaper aktuálně . cz has members of the new council , from the time a little ' abgeklopft ' , as they deal with the notorious slang over the past few years , in which the current coalition partners in prague at the helm , has got to dominate čssd were . 
<finished>: the vocabulary , which , in the era of mayor pavel bém of the prague political elite is some of the most well - known actors , situations and causae entlehnt , was introduced verflossenen codierte . 
<finished>: surprisingly , it became apparent that the new councils in relation to these new concepts of something in the dark . 
<finished>: the claim that they at least . 
<finished>: " anyone who is voldemort ? ' 
<finished>: " i have no idea . " 
<finished>: " i am more of a newcomer in the prague policy ' , the new town councillor for culture , on the test of the ' godfathers - words ' kaucký lukáš , responded . 
<finished>: but also the alderman karel březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way . 
<finished>: for example , on the concept of ' golfloch ' . 
<finished>: " this is the only expression of which you have here present , i occasionally use . " 
<finished>: " otherwise , i think not a lot of often infiltrated by slang . " 
<finished>: from the vocabulary , tageblatt aktuálně . cz in june before the electoral congress of the ods , pickte the editorship of six concepts , above all , of the sort that is notoriously with the prague magistrate had published this year , which is the are linked . 
<finished>: the social democrats should the concepts of ' ' , ' ' , ' ' , ' ' , ' ' and ' betrayal of the capital verblechen ' stiernacken konditorei go in the golfloch greatest prague voldemort define . 
<finished>: three of the test , the fourth - weinert , the future head of the prague school system - promised his participation in the conversation , then took the but not time the policemen first , although mr voted in prague aldermen . 
<finished>: the fifth alderman , petr dolínek , rejected the test from the outset . 
<finished>: " these things are and how the civil democrats among themselves about judgments . " i do not have that , regardless of me 
<finished>: " for me , it is important , as we are within the framework of our programmes to understand , " made the cutting it . 
<finished>: as has already been indicated , would have lukáš kaucký in the headline , allegedly , entrepreneurs and friend of the ex - mayor bém , roman janoušek the speech is influential not recognised that the mentioned above . 
<finished>: the concept of ' voldemort ' says kaucky and the only concept , the test correctly erriet , was " the biggest prague golfloch ' in it , nothing at all . 
<finished>: " this is the tunnel blanka ' , says kaucký to safety but added : " but i know that there is more out of the newspaper . " added , 
<finished>: and jokingly referred to : ' i will probably be a sprachkurs show . " 
<finished>: " the ' will then not only of matador karel březina , but also by the town councillor for the environment lukáš plachý right as tunnel blanka golfloch entziffert . 
<finished>: both social democrats also know , however , for whom the concept of voldemort lukáš plachý senses even where this figure is to be found , and it is also what it means to be " in the konditorei to go and is " . 
<finished>: " i believe it is , that is to say , in some kind of prague gastronomiebetrieb to go ' , is plachý fairly close to the solution , when we know that this is the seat of janoušeks firms problem off to . 
<finished>: he is , however , that this knowledge rather from the newspaper to have , as that to him this vocabulary board would be generated subsidiary in line with březina . 
<finished>: the following is anything to go by , it seems , under the social democrats , in fact , no similar settled testteilnehmern slang to give . 
<finished>: " i have also asked my colleagues , but it is apparent that there is such a thing in the us is really not . " 
<finished>: " we call on us , and we also swifts or moniker ' , says the chairman of the prague čssd petr hulínský - of his party members ' hulda ' in colloquial terms to use again name out . 
<finished>: " in the school , i was bříza ( birke ) , but i do not know whether i am also my colleagues ' , tells us , karel březina his moniker call so . 
<finished>: the newspaper deník aktuálně . cz has the name of being tried out and see the since - he works . 
<finished>: alderman weinert is , for the kind of " opa ' or less friendly to the ' old ' , the representatives of miroslav poche , before the elections by party - sponsorship , is considered by some colleagues ' igráček ' ( well - known czech lego - figure ) made the attention is on the machinations of the party members have been mentioned . 
<finished>: moniker are so the only thing that the social democrats in whose use of language . 
<finished>: hulínský may not " hulda but deník aktuálně . cz registered moniker of the prague for yet another chairman , " called him , if it supposedly . 
<finished>: his spitzname ' gummiknüppel - rights ' has to do with the fact that petr hulínský his title doctor juris in the bratislaver college , allegedly , the doctor has acquired . 
<finished>: the government wants the torture of ' witches ' stop and was a brochure out 
<finished>: women who , in burkina faso to be labelled in the rule , some common social features on show , witches . 
<finished>: they include more of the older generation , you will find no work - for example , for health reasons , they are ledig and do not have children . 
<finished>: if one of these women to the witch ' will ' , it will be strictly in isolation , so that they are in the rest of the village is not can be dangerous .

<finished>: the ortsregierung now , against this abnormal ' sozialmaßnahme ' decided to proceed . 
<finished>: and for this reason a brochure , which the ' witch ' stop there was supposed to be . 
<finished>: the matter has but a snag . 
<finished>: " more than seventy per cent of all adults in burkina faso cannot read , " said the newspaper ' derstandard ' on the dilemma of the written information . 
<finished>: to be accused of witchcraft is but also in other african countries . 
<finished>: in ghana , the neighbouring country of burkina faso , the twenty - year - old ammy hemmahová of three women and two men were tortured to death - they doused them with petroleum and burned them simply . 
<finished>: on this incident reported u . a . also , the server , the bbc .

<finished>: while the government in burkina faso , at least , the witch - hunt , has the president in the past year , the president himself properly mitgemischt gambianische to trying to defuse . 
<finished>: " president yahya jammeh following the death of his aunt , a monstrous witch - hunt , because these supposedly share of their death , and now also the president himself by black magic , had to try and remain ways . " 
<finished>: " from the middle of guinea to aid , the police , soldiers and the president of men and women who have been kidnapped and at the farm , said the organisation amnesty international in its report that led to " the president in kanilai villages forcibly expelled from gambianischen arrested indiscriminately leibgarde of in monitoring schamane to , he called on . 
<finished>: on the farm , has been the one absud from plants with halluzinogener effect to drinking , but which also gastro - and nierenprobleme , imprisoned people forced from . 
<finished>: two of the people who survived the residence on the farm , not arretierten . 
<finished>: it was on the basis of the international pressure has been almost a thousand prisoners released . 
<finished>: a tenant of bakala : he revives , although in the kiln - nevertheless pays higher rent 
<finished>: an older man who is leaving the company rpg byty kohlebarons ' zdeněk bakala , of the greatest privatbesitzers of renting in the czech republic , " the klientenzentrum untersetzter precisely .

<finished>: " but what i call ' , says he was half - annoys and half possessions - signed note . 
<finished>: the residents ' association bytyokd . cz , the new mietbedingungen as ' incorrect and immoral , the renters , the new treaties , simply not to sign , and until the seventh of december to wait , in which they have a guidance intends to publish , as opposed to such contracts advises " referred to , amongst other things . 
<finished>: but the man rears its head only . 
<finished>: " a says it , and the other is the ' , it makes an obscurantist system face . 
<finished>: the region ostrava will thus benefit the big ' deregulierungslabor ' . 
<finished>: after deregulation the most renting in the czech republic before , whose tenants have not hitherto been rent - oriented figures this is new . 
<finished>: aktuálně . cz decided , therefore , this ' lab ' personally to visit . 
<finished>: the rpg - waiting room in havířov is one of four in the region ostrava and already nine o ' clock in the morning in this tuesday packed . 
<finished>: equally , in addition to the door , there are the bodyguards a safety agency and in its a aufrufgerät . 
<finished>: " rent 2011 ' , so a special tastfeld on the touchscreen stands . 
<finished>: briefly touched upon this and has already been spuckt the device a nummernzettel from . 
<finished>: we hardly have the number ' 157 ' entziffert and already piepst you on the big screen an indication from the ceiling of the warteraums . 
<finished>: a half - minute later , is seen in the series . 
<finished>: a little later , a married couple in the waiting room , in order to ask , but the arrival of the waiting room is apparently not even the new rent after the older enters the story . 
<finished>: the majority of people are here to the usual problems to solve , reparaturanträge , insurance and so on . 
<finished>: in mid - november in the region ostrava the kuverts with the new mietverträgen most tenants of the thousand homes of the portfolios of the rpg in the letter boxes . overall 44 fly from . 
<finished>: the rpg byty proposes to you in the letter a mieterhöhung around until 38 . per cent before . 
<finished>: the special counters for the new hire in klientenzentrum is since the eighteenth november opened . 
<finished>: " the action is a little over a week , that is to say , it is only the beginning , " replies the ladies behind the counter , after a moment of hesitation , as the ' ' as a journalist safeguarded turns . 
<finished>: the deregulation and bakalas former bergarbeiterwohnungen are a hot topic . 
<finished>: before the elections , from ostrava parlamentsvizepräsident lubomír zaorálek čssd this issue , it is no wonder that , today , the newspapers are full of them picked up quite trumpeted the originating from . 
<finished>: " twenty years i shall give you a new floor . " 
<finished>: " not once ne besch . wc - glasses , they were able to change ' , makes the aforementioned man air . 
<finished>: until now , above all , in order to convince people , and whether they really get the rpg promises , if you have the time spezialangebot mietermäßigung the promised to pensioners on the desk , according to the staff are to sign . 
<finished>: in the half for reduced februarmiete should also take into account the other tenants , the new rental until the fifteenth december sign a benefit . 
<finished>: until now , is " deregulierungsschalter ' in havířov but everything else , as overloaded by follow - up questions . 
<finished>: " from yesterday 's 360 clients were only forty or fifty years 2011 because here ' , to appreciate the schalterbeamtinnen in until the rent . 
<finished>: rpg both on their websites , as well as wandtafeln individual mietvereinbarungen , where it is necessary to make offers . 
<finished>: should the mietparteien but not on the new rent a few , will you of an independent court . 
<finished>: " this is not a threat , but as a piece of information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach to understand , " said rpg on his websites . 
<finished>: " no one goes to court , " says one of the staff of rpg byty and a man on the street before the klientenzentrum is she has at least partly right . 
<finished>: " i have thirteen . thousand ( crowns ) pension , five thousand eat , where should i get the money for a gerichtsstreit ' , says he plans to spare . i am convinced will remain for the time being . 
<finished>: only then will the employees but uncertain . 
<finished>: " time to see . " 
<finished>: " mr zaorálek says you on the media , you should not sign , and so are the people still from " , it concerns . 
<finished>: the regulated rent ends in the largest part of the czech republic to 2011 and rpg byty is the mieterhöhung an economic necessity , according to the new year . 
<finished>: " the existing level of rents is not enough time for the maintenance of the wohnfonds from ' pavel klimeš , the director of the portfolios of the society rpg byty and - it is precisely the of the tenants of neglect of wohnungsfonds is in the opinion of the homeowner , the main reason for the mieterhöhung criticised , among others - including housing argues , . 
<finished>: while in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the four billion in the housing and invest in the four years of 2011 until 2014 should it five , two billion , was able to rent collected rpg be . 
<finished>: on the großformatigen lcd countries - display from the ceiling in the waiting room of havířov crop up again and again a couple of red shining information on . then polstersesseln towards the 
<finished>: " the mieterhöhungen 2011 less concern 31 bicentenary homes , which means more than ninety percent of the homes of rpg . and in order to fifteen percent in years ' 
<finished>: this means a maximum of seventh , fifty czk per square metre and month ' , is on the lcd countries - screen to always ' read . 
<finished>: only in 400 homes from the portfolio of rpg has increased the rent by 38 per cent . 
<finished>: " in these cases , it is extremely low , 66 per square metre , " argued rpg czk mietpreise in order to the increase of nineteenth . 
<finished>: in 2600 homes remains the rent in the next year at the same level . 
<finished>: rpg byty promises that the deregulation of the rents are not in , but gradually within four and eight years ago , is driving the amount at an exponential rate . 
<finished>: what is more - and this is a further obligation : all of the revenue from the mieterhöhung ( see graph ) wants to put the company back in , especially in new windows and in the thermal insulation . in wärmeersparnisse - are the homes that were imposed on companies 
<finished>: but - as a priority , to use this to those people who benefit from the agreements on the mieterhöhung sign . 
<finished>: the architects saw a - the office is also part of a nursery 
<finished>: the office building avriopoint in brno is the new headquarters of the company arch . design . 
<finished>: but who would expect , with all the colourful , creative furniture , a lot of toys and even a minispielplatz on the außenterrasse walls : what minikindergarten here will already be a part of this . 
<finished>: this year the staff of arch . design available to generators is since kindergarten . 
<finished>: the projektierungs - and architekturbüro arch . design , a whole series of eminent brünner buildings of the first drafts of the new buildings avriopoint to with the premises for its companies - minikindergarten ago come , ateliers from its . 
<finished>: that is because the vast majority of his staff ( inside ) are in the baby - age , and the company is keen to ensure that the projektantinnen and architektinnen as quickly as possible to their place of work to return to ninety foresight in wise . 
<finished>: together with the possibility of reduced to the nursery is a further bonus , the arch . design of its employees in the concept of their sozialprogrammes has to offer is working . 
<finished>: the bauingenieurinnen and - architektinnen have it easier , their challenging work and child care to reconcile . 
<finished>: the minikindergarten is an original idea of the staff ( inside ) of arch . design , and with the support of the management of the european union and of the ministry of labour and social affairs for their project funding managed to win . 
<finished>: the occupational minikindergarten operationsprogramm employment policy from the resources of the european social fund and from the staatsbudget of the czech republic , and will be replaced by the human resources to be financed . 
<finished>: thanks to this financing ( subsidies in eight million czk ) have been able to make the necessary facilities and equipment , and for the duration of two years is for qualified staff and for the operation to be procured , the level of awareness . 
<finished>: according to the absorption of the funds ( two years ) is the society arch . design is obliged to ensure the minikindergarten three other years at their own expense to continue to pursue . 
<finished>: the preparation of this project was for a whole year , and the economy rating in the society in antragsabwicklung energetic assistance . 
<finished>: in order to give the children qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergartenlehrerin , the nursery school children can without altersmäßige restrictions , even though the majority of them on a three - year - old are visiting ganztätig takes care of itself . 
<finished>: and since it is a mini - nursery is only five children to be present , however , the day on a number of children each change at the same time , we must reject . 
<finished>: the kindergartenbetrieb is flexible , to the needs of the parents have been voted on , the children of all staff have in relation to the use of the kindergartens the same rights - without regard to the firmenhierarchie and their respective positions . 
<finished>: despite the fact that it is individual education and care of programminhalt in the mini - nursery school , nevertheless , comparable with the framework programme of pre - school education is talking , . 
<finished>: the children to play here , and not just , above all , you will be excellent teaching of basic knowledge , up to and including the vorschulunterricht , incidentally , they learn also still - offered in english . 
<finished>: the classroom is not only with toys and creative play , but also with a computer , the children should be made available . 
<finished>: what is more , the presence of small children in the company contributes to a kind and positive firmenmilieu in . 
<finished>: the parents can at any time to take a look at the children and the stress of the children from a far - off nursery school to collect in the late fall so . 
<finished>: the parents , therefore , take advantage of their working hours , more productive . 
<finished>: no wonder , then , that here , too , there are natural and loyal employer - employee relationship develops . 
<finished>: arch . design reihte so under the czech firms in the recruitment of new staff to clear benefits " offer , the family - friendly , and by means of programmes of this kind for your staff - the a , marketing and strengthen it . 
<finished>: a knochenhaus fascinated also still looking for a hundred years . if you look at the interieure of gaudi to 
<finished>: the roof of the backs of prehistoric echse , such as the vertebral column of a dinosauriers and the balkone are aufgerissene fischmäuler went as seems to be . 
<finished>: this is the casa batlló of catalan architect antonio gaudi in barcelona . 
<finished>: by the inhabitants of the house with his organic forms the moniker ' knochenhaus got here ' . 
<finished>: organic forms , wild colours , the unusual use of stone , kachelsplittern and mosaic , the ubiquitous soft lines , all of which are typical features for the jugendstil of antonio gaudi and scales erinnernde façades . 
<finished>: the façade of the house is playing with beautiful lines , zärtlichen colours and texturen , to nature and the creatures . 
<finished>: only if we look carefully , that everything from geometry , rhythm and thoughtful order dominated by one noted . 
<finished>: in the night , the whole frontage is still plastic , dramatic and the specific anleuchtung stepped up the glamour of the colours still . 
<finished>: the same dynamic lines and tortuous forms dominate the home of the house . 
<finished>: parliament spouting out waves of geformtes wood copied the window frames , geländer , zierelemente of doors , even gucklöcher and make . 
<finished>: the house in the quarter to the busy shopping road passeig de grácia 43 a house from the years 1877 , the architects of emilio sala cortese restructuring was created by the no . eixample batlló said . 
<finished>: the americans took two years and was in 1906 completed . 
<finished>: the investor , the wealthy industrial batlló originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building , but in the end he joined the idea gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper restructuring to stock , mr josep . 
<finished>: the mietshaus casa batlló noted , antoni gaudí , however , is not the only one . 
<finished>: he was working with the architects , josep maria jujol together . 
<finished>: it is precisely on the drawing board has been created take away the rhetorical flourishes for the representative of the realitätenbesitzers and also the use of mosaiken to the facade was his idea of housing . 
<finished>: in the design of the facade was also , however , a number of other bildner and artists with . 
<finished>: the joint work of the drafts for the casa batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of jujola and gaudí . 
<finished>: so , too , on the construction of gaudís house casa milá in the park güell , in which there are also other works of antoni gaudí jujol involved is located . 
<finished>: shortly after the house of the inhabitants of his organic forms because of the moniker ' knochenhaus ' absence was his completion . 
<finished>: others , however , called it the special fensteröffnungsmechanismus because of the " yawning house ' . 
<finished>: we , too , says , on the top of the building was the sword of the holy georg , the existence of catalonia . 
<finished>: but also further bildhauerische elements symbolise hidden religious motives . 
<finished>: for the house for the unique zentralheizungssystem with entlüftungskanälen and typical kaminen time then outlined gaudí . 
<finished>: a little bizarre seems to be their 45 - degree inclination already . 
<finished>: in his create ignored gaudí consistently all the time and it has by no means of these regulations be distracted . 
<finished>: before the start of construction - from the city to the appropriate planning permission but the claims made on the planned were so vague that the stadtväter two years later , on the occasion of the completion of so horrified by the outcome were that they help reconstruction of him by a while holte he demanded . 
<finished>: the aldermen , among other things , to the fact that the construction , with its pillars , even in the public bürgersteig is met with interference . 
<finished>: there was , however , not more , quite the opposite - only fifteen days after the call of the stadtviertels batlló an application to approve the lease of the two höchstgelegenen stockwerke of the house - and it was him promptly , josep was in changes to be granted . 
<finished>: the homeowner himself drew in the lower floors . 
<finished>: in the gallery , in the second floor of a gesellschaftssalon , the third floor of the bedroom and found themselves privaträume the housing is found . . 
<finished>: the ground floor has been in a juweliergeschäft leased out . 
<finished>: the whole sechsstöckige buildings is going through a went right up to the dachterrasse . 
<finished>: by the fundamental elements were all right - wing corner and lines to be removed , and by bent and geschwungene walls replaced over redevelopments of . 
<finished>: worked but also with a modern approach to the mutual link from gaudí spaces . 
<finished>: the social part of the opening - up of the salontüren completely combine a greater society comfortably chatting , without in vertraulicheren talks to a certain degree of intimacy to have been able to , and so by itself can be . 
<finished>: the house has received by gaudís except a new facade , also a rather unusual thing roof and two other stockwerke restructuring . 
<finished>: impressively is also gaudís game with the light , as well as the blue and white glasierten kacheln , with those of the courtyard dressed , and is the lichthöfe . 
<finished>: the game of these two colours gives all the floors of the house , a maximum of light . 
<finished>: he is quite simply the principle to know better , as a dark colours , the light from the sun , on the contrary , this would absorb . reflects the light that made it 
<finished>: the house casa batlló that the list of unesco world heritage site has been included , can , today , everyone - in visits . 
<finished>: the first floor is the geräumigste and prächtigste housing accessible to the public . 
<finished>: the homeowner decided to take this step and that on the occasion of the 150 . birthday of the famous years only in the creator . 
<finished>: as we said , that this is a right big business is one of the surveys , they also on further common and the dachgeschossräume , including the dachterrasse . momentum yes we reserved , 
<finished>: the price to visit the baudenkmals , however , is no trifling matter , he is , students , pensioners , groups and holders of touristenausweisen get twenty per cent reduction eur sixteen , fifty . 
<finished>: this amount exceeds the eintrittspreise to other gaudí - buildings in the city . 
<finished>: who are the real atmosphere of the house with his drachentürmchen know would like to learn , should try to friendship with one of the hausbewohner to close , and for him to be home visits . 
<finished>: the right matratze and the right bettenrost ? women have other wishes than men 
<finished>: not the tollste bettrahmen , but the quality of the liegefläche - in other words , matratze and make the good bed - from . 
<finished>: this must , however , is the harmonious complement to the wishes of the specific user will be able to meet . 
<finished>: in the selection of play a role in weight , the size , the state of health and , last but not least , the sex of the schläfers - on many issues . 
<finished>: just as important is also the interieur , in which matratze and - subordinate . 
<finished>: a typical example of this ? 
<finished>: in a wochenendhaus , in the heated latexmatratzen not well suited for much longer , since they need in order to " warm " are not regularly , will be . 
<finished>: in addition , they are clearly more difficult than usual produce mattresses . 
<finished>: and they should regularly be turned . 
<finished>: if you do not have enough entlüftungskanälchen at the heart of this on a firm is congested and humidity : so it is not excluded that , among their mould will , record , are still have and which is to be implemented . 
<finished>: in the election , of course , also plays a role in what we are accustomed to . 
<finished>: anyone who has a longer period of time abroad was , where very high mattresses with weichschicht are common practice , will be difficult to a low matratze with hard surface to get used to . 
<finished>: " i think all eishockeyspieler , from the nhl have complained to me that they are no longer able to sleep right , have come back . " 
<finished>: " for their heels and hüften you need simply a weichschicht from visco - foam ( memory foam - a - polymer ) ' formgedächtnis , abgeschundenen shoulders . 
<finished>: " this , i recommend that , among other things , also diabetics amongst people who are suffering , so that they are the ' information ' from the gelenken and the skin is bad , " said sylva hadamcziková on polstermöbel can receive nervous system a disruption of the specialised . 
<finished>: that is why i voted in favour of many , but also other customers of these mattresses with visco - foam ( memory foam eishockeyspielern years ago ) concerned . 
<finished>: " today , this is no longer a problem , because such mattresses offer . the manufacturer tempur , the italian company magniflex or the czech manufacturers tropico . a metro . " 
<finished>: and we must not necessarily be a famous eishockeyspieler , in order to safeguard the advantages of the visco - schaums learn to appreciate . 
<finished>: this ' miracle ' works are actually quite simple . 
<finished>: the foam optimalisiert his toughness and form , in accordance with the absorbierten heat , in other words , he schmiegt is downright on hot body . 
<finished>: nowhere is it , in the dead of night shifts we are not around , such as after a major fight . 
<finished>: we are simply much better . 
<finished>: the viskoelastische foam offers protection against dekubitus ( gangrene ) . also , moreover , 
<finished>: in the election of the matratzengröße should be on the height , still the length of the fußsohlen , until 34 cm . twenty mature is approximately . 
<finished>: as mrs mann , the to the cm are great , need such a 210 until twenty cm bed wanted . 
<finished>: each of the schläfer should at least ninety cm liegebreite available , together so we wanted cm . 
<finished>: in einzelbetten , for example , in the singles , are 120 until forty cm appropriate . 
<finished>: the semi - and also for any visitors to decide . 
<finished>: otherwise , the rule of thumb for the ideals bettbreite : ' if you have , it should still be enough room for the easy angewinkelten poor ing . helena prokopová , the zunftmeisterin the polsterer and raumausstatter , which is the issue of the healthy and the mean good ergonomics of furniture and this issue is also on schools and sleep for many years already advises " , to be put back on the following applies . 
<finished>: in one of their own , and his own matratze , but be careful when they make purchases , so that the mattresses , too , are equally high - doppelbett everyone needs . 
<finished>: otherwise , there is nothing for it but , as the roste to fit and that is a long time ago not in every bettrahmen possible amount in different . 
<finished>: schaummatratzen should at least fourteen cm , mattresses with federskelett fifteen cm , at least three - inch on the formschicht and the feinpolster should assume to be high . 
<finished>: " with the hand or the sat down in any case ' , warns helena prokopová felt the feathers must be . 
<finished>: every matratze makes a specific rosttyp required . 
<finished>: ganzgepolsterte beds with matratze and document as zusammengewachsene siamzwillinge have in the bedroom . 
<finished>: this mattresses do not allow themselves to be , and the reference you cannot wash , what today is , of course , already reveal , is the order of the day . 
<finished>: and since we are in a single night to sweat , it is clear that the matratze after five to seven years , slowly , to a huge ( and congested sieve ) is , lose , l 2 to . 
<finished>: that is also why we reject experts werbeslogans mattresses a life span of up to twenty - five years ago , yes even lifelong guarantee in that the promise . 
<finished>: every thing has its ifs and buts . 
<finished>: and that is why the council of the traders : in mattresses or forty cm wide of waschbaren , abziehbaren salary is not shy , nonetheless , it is recommended that a matratzenschoner , to use the one easy to leave and wash hygiene should be the 120 of practical a can . 
<finished>: even if today , in the rule matratzenbezüge with rundumreißverschluss so open two halves gets ( immensely important for the waschvorgang and the waschmaschinengröße ! ) , the manipulation with larger mattresses , above all , alone , the unequal struggle between david and goliath . as pointed out , often seems to be the one to be manufactured , according to 
<finished>: have you in the bed , rather than an rostes a firm record ? 
<finished>: get out of it . 
<finished>: or , at most , for a bed for cinderella guests and for a single night . 
<finished>: even so , they should the lüftungslöchern oversight ( if ) , and mattresses with federskelett and fifteen cm minimum with taschenfederkern and feinpolster cleared . are already not included with record , prefer to use . 
<finished>: produce - mattresses are on such a document does not . 
<finished>: for not verstellbare lattenroste with fourteen to eighteen federleisten ( lamellen ) are latex sandwichmatratzen ( also combinations of latex and kokos ) , always pay with a larger lattenanzahl , therefore , and more federleisten lordosenstütze in lendenwirbelbereich , and the possibility of the lattenhärte . it is a question of regulating with , from of roste is . it is necessary or appropriate 
<finished>: on verstellbare lamellenroste does not include mattresses with federskelett , since it is not on the ergonomische subterfuge to respond . 
<finished>: in addition to the attitude of the stiff the federleisten will also be a special flexible schultermodule offered . 
<finished>: it is about a specific integration of federleisten , which will make it possible , the federleisten einzudrücken or even verwinkeln , that they have the occasional einsinken the shoulder of the schläfers to so is this possible . 
<finished>: particularly for men with broad shoulders , an important matter . 
<finished>: there are even matratzenhersteller , have started , " herrenmatratzen ' weichzonen for the schulterbereich in to use . 
<finished>: also in the ladies is thought - you in the hüftgegend weichzonen takes these . 
<finished>: for most sophisticated customers are punktelastische flügelfedersysteme ( lattoflex ) or roste with punktelastischen contact - pads with cleared . multitorsionsfederung determined . 
<finished>: the pressure will be on a number of points which are distributed , the tension is reduced . 
<finished>: but , if you are on the right and a bad ( too big and fülliges ) kopfkissen used to go to the most benefits again lost - matratze right . 
<finished>: here , too , a rule of thumb : the kopfkissen is supposed to be the head , his sharp should only up to the shoulders of rich , so that the schultermuskeln ease . 
<finished>: the ideal situation would therefore seem a fifty x sixty centimetres of great cushion , such as it is , for example , the scandinavians . 
<finished>: in the seitenlage should the kopfkissen ( along with the schulterentlastungszone in or the weichzone in the matratze ) the schulterhöhe - to compensate for . 
<finished>: that is something to which our modern mattresses have with the former ( with hay - filled ) strohsäcken but have in common . 
<finished>: modern manufacturers use are becoming increasingly frequent natural materials , or at least their mixtures . 
<finished>: also in mattresses means the new magic formula " bio " . 
<finished>: instead we used for the manufacture of polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturelle oils - for example , rizinus erdölrohstoffen - and soya oil . 
<finished>: soya will be well aware of all the well - known producers used . 
<finished>: " in the case of mattresses , this will be your heart from materials purely natural origin ' , says petr vašíček of the company tropico plus is organic . 
<finished>: natural products will also be used in the manufacture of matratzenbezügen used - one of the first was aloe vera . 
<finished>: but one can also be mikrokapseln , the sleep of fresh forest - or lavendelduft spread the work . 
<finished>: here , too , makes a difference between a man and a woman . 
<finished>: while the men a " kühlender ' pflanzenextrakt from birkenblättern is used , so that the matratzenbezug the heat and the rest of the body , can have the salary for women ' wärmende ' purify absorb impact . 
<finished>: extracts from red paprikaschoten rain the weaker sex , and will be in the sleep so wohlig warm the blutzirkulation , . 
<finished>: and today 's favourites ? 
<finished>: mattresses from kaltschaum ( he has a greater poren with zellstruktur and is therefore atmungsaktiver as handelsübliches produce , and also in a much more flexible destroyed ) . 
<finished>: the combination of the various stiff ( toughness ) of kaltschäumen and visco - foaming having created more - mattresses , know exactly where head , hip and - zones by heels . 
<finished>: for a high - quality matratze has seven thousand kronor , and more , however , you have to pay . 
<finished>: gesundheitsmatratzen are , however , usually with a lower vat burden , since you , as medical tool to apply . 
<finished>: the first czech company has been gumotex this advantage . 
<finished>: you see , in the matratze and on to save is not so easy - . 
<finished>: and again , there is a special offer of manufacturers and distributors , the two mattresses for the price of one of the offer . 
<finished>: the brand magniflex the matratze duofreeze with verstepptem visco - foam memory for eleven fixing czk . in terms of the offers so . 
<finished>: the second you get for free to do so . 
<finished>: it was the material tempur , the era of viskoelastischen schaumstoffe with open zellstruktur and high - density in almost kosmischem pace gave . 
<finished>: no wonder , then , that they were but for nasa to develop , because the astronauts are in the launch of enormous excessive impositions . 
<finished>: tempur will be in heat soft , in a cool place to entrench it in turn . 
<finished>: so it is the human body is perfect , and distributed in the best possible way , the suits körperdruck . 
<finished>: therefore , it is not only ideal for the prevention of druckbrand , but increased in general the schlafkomfort . 
<finished>: viskoelastische schaumstoffe will , however , not only in mattresses , but also in other gesundheitsprodukten , such as z . b . in particular fußpolstern used the legs and the gefäßen relief . 
<finished>: local manufacturers use , for example , the schaumstoffe eucatherm c , twinsaver or similar products . 
<finished>: more and more parents want to people - controls , in order to ensure the kids under control to have 
<finished>: the fear for the children of their own growing and so are considering more and more parents , they are by gps to monitor . 
<finished>: the system that was originally to cars can be good people places , which is also in such cases would be helpful , as recently in the spurlosen disappearance of the nine year old anička janatková also was invented , namely after tracking down . 
<finished>: the device is about as big as a packet of but soon , it should not be greater than a wristwatch . 
<finished>: many people , the case of the missing anička in fear and shock , and so do you think ways and means , their children better looking to protect . 
<finished>: also for the price of a deterioration of its privacy . 
<finished>: " we are trying to do is to say to all of that , it is , but in order to lessen the likelihood that tragedy leads petr pilin macro , one of the suppliers of gps tracking devices would be on the czech market in because of the society , it is " , is an effective means of herumspionieren here is by no means . 
<finished>: " i have to admit that it is in the case of the abuse of such equipment , for example , if someone is in the pocket , he knows , but we have , so far , had no such case . " from that , without it , we can come to 
<finished>: " the majority of customers buy it really , for security reasons , " adds pilin added . 
<finished>: in his opinion , should the child but always know what purpose the ' box ' serves and how they are used in the event of an emergency . 
<finished>: the kinderpsychologin dana bočková notes , however , that a child , if there is such a thing does not bear may be , it is his simply managed to shrug off . 
<finished>: " also , very small children show great creativity when it comes to certain things to lose , if they do not want to be controlled deliberately . " 
<finished>: " mobile phones , awoke with the parents of great expectations , but they can be just as easy , as this new controls ' , says mrs bočková off is initially , already the . 
<finished>: in your opinion , is also controversial , whether such a body in the event of an attack is actually helps . 
<finished>: " in the case of planned the kidnapping of the kidnappers virtually always , whether or not the child of any electronics in itself , has , with which it could be too controlled . " 
<finished>: " today , it is the mobile phone . " 
<finished>: " if such wider use , they would also have to seek it out , because it is on sale for sure by massive advertising would be " accompanied were controls . 
<finished>: " in these cases are the criminals of the police is always one step ahead of ' , says the psychologist . 
<finished>: they are , however , recognises that similar devices in a sudden attack by a paedophile , a well that could be useful . 
<finished>: roberta čech rc monitoring the ortungsdienstleistungen both for cars , as well as for the existence of such a device in question then , too , to help if it immediately after the attack to be destroyed . can people offering , according to the society of 
<finished>: " the device so that the respective position in certain intervals , it is impossible to stop to speak . " 
<finished>: " even if it would be destroyed , it is at least the last position of the person concerned is available immediately . " 
<finished>: " in the case of more expensive equipment is even a neigungsmesser integrated , that is to say , if you hinfällt and bewegungslos remains , sends out a warning to the position ' , claims mr čech indication immediately under the device are . 
<finished>: in his opinion , could have similar services are also smart mobile phones with navigation , it just needs a special software to carry out einzuspielen . 
<finished>: the problem with the current ortungsgeräte , either in order to machines in a matchbox - size , the supporters are similar to , or in order to smaller phones this that it is . 
<finished>: there is always the risk that they will lose . 
<finished>: mr pilin of the macro because , according to testing , therefore , we in the present , the devices such as normal digitaluhren appearance . 
<finished>: " this has the advantage that the possible attackers not at all has to recognise that it is a system of monitoring or localisation device which makes . 
<finished>: " or he notices the only after a certain period of time , what the police a zeitvorsprung is ' , while adding he added . 
<finished>: regardless of the direction in which the development of armbändern or supporters , always will be , the same technology used , as in the case of fahrzeugortung to - ing . 
<finished>: therefore , the combination of ortungsfunktion through the gps system ( as well as in the car ) and the role of a mobile phone for the current position of ms in the reports . 
<finished>: the army has so many zündschnüre , that the czech republic umwickeln could keep them but only two years quite one 
<finished>: the czech army has 445 kilometres zündschnüre bought with detonated bomb . 
<finished>: in the year before , the ministry of defence has already 224 kilometres zündschnur to the armeelager supplied . 
<finished>: it is reassuring to know that the armed forces for five years ausgesorgt have . 
<finished>: the only problem is the shelf - life of zündschnüre - two , but no more than four years . 
<finished>: the army has bought the zündschnüre of the limited liability company stv . s . for läppische forty million kroner ( a group that . 
<finished>: in his explanatory statement , for the purchase of this enormous amount of zündschnur replied to the general staff mf dnes , the soldiers would annually to the sixty miles zündschnur consume . 
<finished>: the armeepyrotechnikern mf dnes is from this claim , though , that the whole army each year , a very intensive training of all the generals and officers of the armeekommandos , right up to the secretaries and putzfrauen - should be replaced , the point is that , according to the research by raised . 
<finished>: defence minister alexandr vondra and sponsored vlastimil picek not excluded . 
<finished>: only in this way can the remarkable annual consumption of sixty miles zündschnüren reasonably justified . 
<finished>: this length corresponds to the twenty - thousand detonationen . 
<finished>: but even so , they would armeebestände for more than ten years of the rich . 
<finished>: if , however , still the old rule of experts is that each new military professionals two metres zündschnur , then the army by these neueinkäufe - also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pioneer - and special units - a reassuring stock for the already mentioned five years is quite sufficient training has to be created . 
<finished>: soldiers of the defence minister vondra , you would have had almost no cartridges for more , so that test firing at the lack of resources because of are greatly restricted handguns recently schnelleinsatzbrigade in received . 
<finished>: the unterhosenmangel , not to mention . 
<finished>: " to me , is also not a why you from us such vast zündschnüre buy . " 
<finished>: but this is ultimately their decision , you will already know , to what you need . " 
<finished>: " for us , it is the army to be a good customer , which we , as traders as far as possible ' , says the vertriebsmanager the stv group jan děcký want to come forward . 
<finished>: jan pejšek , the spokesman for the department of defense of hundreds of kilometres of the army for at least ten years with this ' ammunition ' eingedeckt . so , would have been so zündschnur justified the shopping 
<finished>: jan děcký stv speaks only of a four - year gebrauchsdauer the zündschnüre and police - and only two years of armeepyrotechniker even , however , by the group . 
<finished>: " in the case of perfect storage are probably also the four years is possible ' , admits that there is one of them , however , remain nameless , not the criticism of the army accused soldier wants to in order , as i have mentioned to be . 
<finished>: after the expiry of the gebrauchsdauer must any ammunition thoroughly be tested , whether they still are reliable and not the lives of soldiers at risk . 
<finished>: these tests are not , however , in vain , but costs money . 
<finished>: a further argument in the department of defense is the mengenrabatt for the 445 kilometres zündschnur . 
<finished>: " they are sixty per cent less than last year 's supply of 244 kilometres , " spokesman pejšek the position of the purchasers might arise from the ministry of defence with us shares have . 
<finished>: only by way of comparison , the annual consumption of zündschnüren of the police , the ammunition from the second world war or the soviet bruderarmee struggles for a number of years , hardly 1 . 500 already exceeds pyrotechnikern metres . 
<finished>: and , the police ordered only ever such quantities of these munitions , the it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer can consume . 
<finished>: already , the safety of pyrotechniker because , in addition to the possibility of a flexible and also , therefore , reliable zündschnüre open more modern purchases so they are . 
<finished>: the ministry of defence has already huge problems in the winding - up of the tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the times of the warsaw treaty , as the people 's army on its campaign on the rhine czechoslovak zweihunderttausendköpfige prepared . 
<finished>: the pyrotechnikern mf dnes expected the czech armed forces in a couple of years ago , the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old zündschnüre , which you are now so ' favourable ' has bought , raised , according to . 
<finished>: until today , i have the contacts that the i - thanks to the competition had won 
<finished>: the winning location in the competition , " of the year , " have lukáš pytloun in the sale of the franchise his hotels helped small entrepreneurs . 
<finished>: the winner of the last of the competition of the year " was carried out by liberec lukáš pytloun from small jahrganges ' . 
<finished>: the history of his success is as a filmszenarium . 
<finished>: lukáš pytloun went to . 
<finished>: abroad he has been aware of the fact that it in carried out by liberec of good übernachtungsmöglichkeiten at reasonable prices is missing only . 
<finished>: from the savings of its ferienarbeiten abroad , and with the help of a bankkredits erstand he a baufälliges house with five homes . 
<finished>: bearing in mind the fact that he was a university student in the sixth semester was , this was certainly a daunting . 
<finished>: " the price - quality ratio , i was actually frustrated and so i tried to do something about it ' , says former lukáš pytloun . 
<finished>: the first rekonstruierte housing rented it to auslandsarbeiter . 
<finished>: the whole of the profit he immediately back into the house , which he then step for step to retire with fifty beds umbaute invested . 
<finished>: since then , only seven years of entrepreneurial activity carried out by liberec four , two restaurants and two hotels with a overall capacity of more than three hundred beds all unterkunftskategorien stilgerechte pensions in in managed him to open up . 
<finished>: the komfortabelste was until recently the viersternehotel ' pytloun design hotel you of ' . 
<finished>: in this year , came another first - rate hotel added . 
<finished>: " we have just had a contract with a hotel in ostrov tisé our franchise and other interested parties on the pytloun - hotels have already reported , ' says the entrepreneurs number one last year by franchise have sold - concept which we signed , metro . 
<finished>: " this lizenzverkauf had just the victory in the competition , " entrepreneurs of the year ' , adds mr pytloun hotels on the large proportion of the instigation of appreciation . 
<finished>: the victory has given him a greater visibility , yes popularity in carried out by liberec and surroundings . 
<finished>: " the people i am on the side of the road , often me even in retrospect and i must say that the fact right good ' , he congratulated identified themselves . 
<finished>: i would recommend to absolutely all of something , they want to create in this competition . 
<finished>: we also need not be immediately to win every visible is a good thing . 
<finished>: he says that he is up to today , from the contacts and acquaintances benefits , to which it would otherwise not at all would have come . 
<finished>: " with some of the people that i , thanks to the competition have met , i have until now regular business . hold ' 
<finished>: with the success of glory is its opinion , it is also a little in any of his staff associated reflected . 
<finished>: and , as he has in the seventy . 
<finished>: " i notice you in greater loyalty and proud of the fact that they are part of something , the general recognition will be given . " 
<finished>: i can see this not only as a personal success , no , this is the result of the good work carried out by all of us really also . " 
<finished>: " my name is only a little to the fore , " says lukáš pytloun modest . 
<finished>: my successors , i wish for a year , as we did in farmet had an 
<finished>: the euphoria of victory for was quickly from the consequences of the crisis in its wake . 
<finished>: thanks to his single - mindedness has farmet the worst is behind them . 
<finished>: the price for the first rank of the competition , vodafone company of the year in the last vintage took karel žďárský , the firmeninhaber of farmet . 
<finished>: the jury at the time , the effort , with whom he is from the small werkzeugbau in česká skalice a company from the ground stampfte , the hundreds of millions of sales paid tribute to power . 
<finished>: " i can say that not only myself , but also all of my staff are encouraged and our self - confidence in the fight with the competition has reinforced ' , says the vorjahresgewinner tribute to these . 
<finished>: at the beginning of the firmengeschichte of farmet state of the effort , something useful to do so . 
<finished>: and then the state his father karel žďárský as compensation for the property a small workshop to rent it for a long time , his career in the company , in which he had , until then , and with a few of his father , a separate company to manufacture of plastikwannen . comrades founded sausen was left not hesitated , offered confiscated by the communists as 
<finished>: a short time later , they began to pflanzenölpressen to concentrate on that . 
<finished>: eighteen years ago , they are the largest manufacturer of automatic frame in the whole of central europe , it comes from within . 
<finished>: but it is only through the success in the aforementioned competition and whose medialisierung , it is also the not - specialized public awareness of what has happened . 
<finished>: " not only that our customers the brand farmet now clearly our foreign partners , too , began with a company to be able to work in your own country , the greatest possible success , " says mr karel žďárský . attach , has acquired greater value , due to the fact that more intensive exercise 
<finished>: last year , however , not only in the sign of the euphoria of victory for farmet was in . 
<finished>: the celebration was drawn up on the basis of the economic results of the company in the years 2008 and a part of 2009 from . 
<finished>: and it is precisely 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of werkzeugbauprodukten . 
<finished>: the crisis , which at that time were still less the citizens but , above all , companies schüttelte , reached its peak - many firms were forced to give up their investment projects and new facilities and the purchase of just technologies . 
<finished>: " this situation we could , of course , also does not escape . " 
<finished>: " the forty per cent back , we have had to limit production and even resort to redundancies ' , says mr karel žďárský in order to increase turnover went 
<finished>: a viable companies must also sometimes such unpopular measures . 
<finished>: it is , however , that the situation in order to control and the company in the black figures , even if with lower than before the crisis was . 
<finished>: the company was not willing to make cuts in the investment in research and development - a in . 
<finished>: " we have a research - and schulungszentrum , we bestärkten our presentation on international hauptpreise exhibitions , ' says žďárský . domestic measure and bought in buildings from the grant 
<finished>: everything indicates that we have come through the crisis . 
<finished>: the turnover to grow again , and with them , the number of new staff . 
<finished>: " the new winner , i wish for a great deal of pleasure in the victory , but in a more calm " , mr karel žďárský accordingly . 
<finished>: an opinion poll , with the nonsensical regulations aufräumt 
<finished>: the opinion poll " the absurdity of the year ' is the fourth time the part of unternehmerwettbewerbs . 
<finished>: some of the nonsensical regulations has succeeded in already , from the world to create . 
<finished>: the winners of the next to the poll " absurdity of the year , " the duty , documents on the authorities to create , the online are available in the born dubious . 
<finished>: so , it was decided , more than a third of not quite four thousand stimmabgebenden entrepreneurs . 
<finished>: so the sozialversicherungsverwaltung a papierauszug from the commercial , even if it 's by two of the click of a mouse can retrieve officials would have demanded . 
<finished>: thanks to the opinion poll , this will change now . 
<finished>: " the czech sozialversicherungsverwaltung will , in the future , in the controls of sozialversicherungszahlern no extracts from the commercial demand more ' , led the spokeswoman čssz jana buraňová . 
<finished>: the meaning and purpose of the absurdity of the year ' is it , all the rules and orders under the auspices of the entrepreneurs in the czech republic have to meet and the foolishness of the lift , to take " opinion poll . 
<finished>: this is the fourth time the part of a unternehmerwettbewerbs tsch business daily ( hn ) will be hosted and in terms of public opinion . , by the already in this year of growing popularity . 
<finished>: if in the past year to the three thousand people in the vote of those involved , it was in this year have already been four thousand . 
<finished>: no wonder , because there are still a lot of legal obligations , which only serve to make the business activity to obstruct . 
<finished>: " what , for example , the number of einkommenssteuerformulare is concerned , we are in the world , is a " havlíček small and medium - sized businesses and gewerbetreibender the czech republic association of the said karel rank a front . 
<finished>: the simplification of entrepreneurial activity is in the last few years the proclaimed objective of all the governments . 
<finished>: in comparison to the rest of the world , the situation in the czech republic , however , hardly improved . 
<finished>: according to data from the world bank is the czech republic in relation to the unternehmensbedingungen the , compared to the previous year in order to eight seats in a worse ranking of a legal act rank . 
<finished>: the competition of the absurdity of the year was the first time in years , declared a state of emergency and plays like every year , according to the same script . 
<finished>: everyone can of april until the end of september , administrative redaktionsschluss of competition and bureaucratic nonsense to speak . 
<finished>: the website address www . firmaroku . cz . then the organisers of the competition seven candidates for the " antipreis ' public websites www . firmaroku . cz / absurdita and www . ihned . cz vote on the internet on the go , and is seeking to serve on the registration . 
<finished>: it carries one absurdity , the most votes gets . 
<finished>: the year 's opinion poll has already been more than a hundred , or , more accurately , a little pointless rules and orders have been registered . 
<finished>: the tips are not only of entrepreneurs , but also of professional organisations and journalists . 
<finished>: under the nominees ' finalisten ' of the competition are provisions that instandhaltungsfahrzeuge expressways and toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty members of staff , two offices , and two toilets every two years vorrichten must have to pay to for motorways , too , so , for example . 
<finished>: the list of this year 's " seven " is on the sides of the competition . 
<finished>: the proclamation of the competition at the beginning of november , at the prague wenceslas square is part of one of the personalities of the political and public life also regularly happenings , to each of them . 
<finished>: for example , the executive director of the association of small or medium - sized businesses and the republic , as well as petr kužel , the president of the chamber of commerce of the tsch . republic in the height of the competition with . gewerbetreibender tsch svobodová eva were in this year of the game . 
<finished>: " where is the state of the entrepreneurs club between , there can be no real economic , therefore , it is my goal , every year at least thirty today unnecessarily difficult ' , martin , the minister of industry and trade with kocourek told their businesses , entrepreneurs , to lift the ban on the still sections give recovery raises the legs . 
<finished>: the efforts , nonsensical orders from the world to create , show an effect . 
<finished>: in the majority of the entrepreneurs - imposed obligation , the permanent station three days in advance of the intention to notify , with a ausstellungsstand to an exhibition or kirmes drive to their gewerbeamt on - the - spot on the period between initially people want . 
<finished>: this duty was force a revision of the gewerbegesetzes lifted . 
<finished>: the duty , the second - largest number of votes received - the duty , of workers in the scope of up to thirty days to notify - was set up by the law on you . ' green card ' abolished pyramid missions to the forced 2007 the . 
<finished>: and of all the good things that are happening are three of them : 
<finished>: the absurdity of the regulation which it imposed , in a mirror , a fridge and two personenwaagen sprechzimmer physiotherapists , elected 2009 was to have . 
<finished>: this regulation has been approved by the ministry of health in this year , some of the fires - the kühlschrankpflicht fell way .

<finished>: the history of each and every one of you is extremely inspirativ and enough material for a self - employed activities article . 
<finished>: even though they are in relation to the subject of their activity is anathema to distinguish their efforts , however , have a common denominator - support and respect . 
<finished>: here it is , for example , to people , because in order to personal problems or the health of its own staff gehandicapte . 
<finished>: under the fourteen finalisten , from the whole of the czech republic , for example , also the prague software company et netera on the emergence of not formal sports activities among its staff , which will then be in a number of tournaments will in a variety of sports , appeared to take part . 
<finished>: another example of a responsible company from the region is the society , which has already been seventeen years main sponsor of a stiftungsfonds for gehandicapte children is bravo isolit - pardubice .

<finished>: obviously , against a fat compensation . 
<finished>: it would also be a sufficient explanation for why he has in his arrest of such a large sum of money in . 
<finished>: luboš g . had already , in the past too good contacts with the pilsner bodenfonds . 
<finished>: so , he played in the issue of the former bosses of bodenfonds václav sankota a role , has been prosecuted , because he is in pieces of confirming whether , on which there is already location decisions to works like ersatzrestitutionen were .

<finished>: while electricity and gas in the whole of the czech republic are the prices for district heating from city to city , more expensive to be different . 
<finished>: above all , greater places are planning to price increases .

<finished>: " we have done everything we can to work with you in contact with , " said außenamtssprecher philip crowley . 
<finished>: " we are ready for this , you have to protect them , if the necessary should be . " 
<finished>: the ice - university 
<finished>: in the ' gelato university " in bologna will eiskonditoren on better seasons prepared . 
<finished>: the three - day grundkurs for future gelatieri has the largest rise and visitors from all over the world . 
<finished>: why is there , in fact , the whole ice ? 
<finished>: the gelatiere and by the gelataio . 
<finished>: the gelatiere , a little old - fashioned the eiskonditor , that represents the cream under any rules of italian eismacherkunst german on since . 
<finished>: the gelataio with a spachtel the ice cream from the kühltheke you in the waffel and sold them , then deletes , of course . 
<finished>: it is in order to know , we must not after anzola dell ' emilia , in the province of bologna . 
<finished>: but anyone who even more on the ice , not on the ' gelato - university ' of the italian company is to know the carpigiani over . 
<finished>: the ice - university has the manufacturers of eismaschinen set up , so that the ice cream from his machines everywhere the high ideals will be italian 2003 in the year . 
<finished>: the three - day grundkurs for future gelatieri has the largest rise and visitors from all over the world . 
<finished>: but there are also mehrtägige spezialkurse schokoladeneis and internships in the hauseigenen eisdiele died around . 
<finished>: some dreams in the mid - crisis of a new career , other car simply treacherous ice of their time putting vague aspirations . 
<finished>: this time it is forty participants from countries of all continents - from brazil on hungary to nineteenth of saudi arabia . 
<finished>: jacky , kunstlehrer from california , loves the slowdown - food movement , and in the country of the industrial ice - cream in the future to a european quality product offering . 
<finished>: anke from berlin is unternehmensberaterin and wants after years in a nerve - racking job a little own eintüten . 
<finished>: two young ägypterinnen , in cairo , a dream of eisdiele to open up . 
<finished>: a man from malta and one from brazil and the quality of the ice cream in their bars to improve - and the canadian housewife yulia , because their children italian ice cream is love . 
<finished>: maestro - gelatiere luciano ferrari said the participants , firstly , the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream . 
<finished>: what is crucial is not only good taste , but also the seidige fluidity and the good consistency . 
<finished>: luciano forgets , in his training , but it will not be the icing on the cake of the national überbaus : ' italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism in latin and at all . " 
<finished>: the first step to manufacture seems quite simple . 
<finished>: luciano topples the milk , cream , milk powder , sugar and stabilizers mixgerät , electronic programme on 85 degree and then immediately on four degrees of cooling . while all of this with a great deal in a grundzutaten 
<finished>: then he is in the process of the machine , and out comes a pasteurised white basiscreme , basis for all milcheissorten on a tap revolves around . 
<finished>: immediately , the teacher with questions bestürmt : can it be ice cream just with natural substances without a stabilising influence ? 
<finished>: how can it be the own experimentierlust free rein to let ? 
<finished>: luciano warns against , the zeitgeist in which mislead . 
<finished>: ice cream ' only from natural ingredients " speech , has , nevertheless , a natural product , such as guarkernmehl from the guarbohne mostly stabilisers used - perhaps by anyone . 
<finished>: of course , one can ice also without only , it must then within a day of being sold , otherwise sackt it in , and the customer bites on a loud eiskörnchen together is , a stabiliser produce . 
<finished>: some variations to the grundmasse are allowed . 
<finished>: it will be more exciting with the flavours . 
<finished>: for the taste of the ice maestro luciano between the ingredients , the people in the fruit department or in the supermarket buying sweets of different . 
<finished>: in addition , there are , there are powder and pasten . 
<finished>: " the suppliers are all trying to foist onto them dozens of woody additions . " 
<finished>: " but they should simply time experimenting . ' 
<finished>: either in the fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit . 
<finished>: or , indeed , in the ice cream from the white grundmasse , with eggs on the yellow and with regard to the basis for all sorts of chocolate - kakaopulver cream will temptations offered . 
<finished>: now the kursteilnehmer to the eismaschinen . 
<finished>: luciano each of four different types of vanilla - chocolate - and - ice - with or without eggs in the grundmasse , with more or less vanillearoma or other natural produce haselnuss mokka - , they can be additives . 
<finished>: the same experiment will also be the fruchteissorten tests . 
<finished>: more flavourings , more fruit - püree - geschmacklich is not necessarily better . 
<finished>: haselnuss - ice tastes do not necessarily nussiger , if there were more hazelnuts includes . 
<finished>: the most popular kiwi - ice is the working group , the more fruits , less water and used to be a little less a stabilising influence . 
<finished>: only a well - balanced mix will highlight the taste of a gelato right , says luciano . 
<finished>: eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise : will pfirsich - püree with a lot of sugar is used , the sugar in grundrezept will be reduced . 
<finished>: for zitroneneis is a extraportion sugar may be needed . 
<finished>: luciano prefers a device with which he has the sugar content of fruchtsorten determined ( wine fairs in order for the oechsle in grape must , shows ) . 
<finished>: fortunately , make it easier for tables the rechnerei . 
<finished>: ice to make requires not so much physical use as it used to be . 
<finished>: not only the equipment for the automatic production of grundmasse helps . 
<finished>: there are also a device , the ice - mix at the same time cremig beaten and on minustemperaturen refrigerators use ready - made in the us . 
<finished>: of all the automation , despite the remain small mishaps are not enough . 
<finished>: the brazilians gustavo roses itself and its kurskollegen with fruchtpüree , as it is the hand blenders hardly differ from spiralling out of control and energy for the bottom of the top until . 
<finished>: " in every course ' , says maestro luciano , " it is only a matter of time until something like this happens . " 
<finished>: inspectors in zwielicht 
<finished>: the european food safety authority ( efsa ) had been used by the with genpflanzen experimentierenden industry are being undermined . 
<finished>: now , as an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology understands testbiotech formulated this accusation , the group of experts . 
<finished>: " it sounds like a conspiracy theory that , but we have been well - documented , " said testbiotech - head on wednesday in munich christoph then . 
<finished>: the head of the european food safety authority ( efsa ) - experts for genetically modified plants , harry kuiper , and another european food safety authority ( efsa ) - an expert were for years , also the lobbyistenverband ilsi under the treaty . 
<finished>: the groups of companies such as monsanto , bayer nestle or of being paid . 
<finished>: the european food safety authority ( efsa ) - test requirements for genpflanzen and am so that , in a clear conflict of interest , criticised then worked to kuiper have significantly . 
<finished>: the european food safety authority ( efsa ) - rules are absatzweise wortgleich with position papers by the ilsi and so that the imprint of the industry , the fact of the authority in the italian parma unqualified is to be controlled . 
<finished>: it was the second time that testbiotech a interessenskollision share your criticism . 
<finished>: it should be a high - level european food safety authority ( efsa ) - recently or transitional period for the swiss agrarkonzern syngenta - and have changed sides requirements without a director . 
<finished>: also , the radio ( mdr ) personal links between the eu and the german federal environment agency , as well as eu parliamentarians sit up and take notice has made . what authority lobbies reveals , function recently had mitteldeutsche 
<finished>: the european food safety authority ( efsa ) can , however , no conflict of interest . 
<finished>: we would like to pick up on all the data on the industry , as long as they are of a high technical quality , it says in a statement of this kind , also serious back . 
<finished>: by the experts , for the european food safety authority ( efsa ) work , not that they were not in contact with the industry , have been asking for . 
<finished>: they would have to this but disclosure . 
<finished>: kuiper gives his work for the life sciences institute ( ilsi ) in the united states , a internationally . 
<finished>: this in itself as a neutral forum of experts from academia , industry and politics - amongst other things , to the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbyauftrag is described . 
<finished>: as to the matter in hand , criticise the independent experts , such as that of genetically modified plants is currently without any fütterungsversuch in animals be allowed and that the response of genpflanzen on environmental influences not being tested will then . 
<finished>: " we want to know what , for example , genetically modified maize on the ground makes ' , says then . 
<finished>: current practice is , quite simply , to an isolated proteins , but not the whole genpflanze to test , and there is no reliable results . 
<finished>: " if the risks are not seeking , how can we then they find ? " asks then anklagend . 
<finished>: this is also the angelika hilbeck so . 
<finished>: the scientist 's all since the genetic engineering and is currently working on the technical university zurich operating in 1994 . 
<finished>: the industry attempts in this area , as in the united states are now also in europe is becoming more and more critical scientists to influence or attempt to discredit . 
<finished>: there is , therefore , hardly even researchers , not with corporations intertwined . 
<finished>: for companies , critical studies would be in the do not , as a rule , was published . 
<finished>: " the industry is controlling the security research ' , claims hilbeck . 
<finished>: the trail of the stones 
<finished>: uli gsell has also what concerned , making a total of around four hundred kilos . 
<finished>: on monday night he was vorm stuttgart station , the tuba on the backs . 
<finished>: it was demo . 
<finished>: it was snowing . 
<finished>: the history is well known : in september , were the excavator angerückt and had started , a major piece of the nordflügels break off . 
<finished>: the stuttgart world was not more of the same : tens of thousands marched against s21 , the resolution tieferlegung station 's . 
<finished>: as for the halt to construction , was a large part of the wing in ruins . 
<finished>: broken in 6 , seven thousand pieces . 
<finished>: crailsheimer muschelkalk , a soft gross stein , between sparked off and was sidelined . 
<finished>: gsell is bildhauer in ostfildern , three years old . 
<finished>: he has a few of the headache will be guaranteed . 
<finished>: " this stones are reliquien . " 
<finished>: " they must not disappear . " 
<finished>: he : " a cheap and poor stone , simple and schwärmt erdenhaft . " 
<finished>: when he was a aufsägte , have voted in favour of the following zigarettenqualm rat . 
<finished>: what he does with the headache is going to make , he knows he is not there yet . 
<finished>: stones have time . 
<finished>: uli gsell also . 
<finished>: the trail of the stuttgart stones leads in a forest in tübingen on a former munitionsdepot of the french army , where manuel rongen be stone - rich has constructed . 
<finished>: of the forty - five - year - old is with old stones . 
<finished>: he has bought all of the demolition in stuttgart , free of charge . 
<finished>: " it would be a shame , she would become schotter gemahlen or in the disappearance " , he says in his office , a holzbüdchen , the once a landfill wachhäuschen was . 
<finished>: and threatened him , he tells , as in september in the newspapers , that he is the remnants of the nordflügels by abbruchunternehmer we have beaten bought . 
<finished>: but he has with the s - twenty - opponents of talk , only to end up . 
<finished>: and he has explained to them that he but now nothing at all for the demolition . 
<finished>: and if it is , then , whether it be but the most sensible , if the stones would be re - used to occur . 
<finished>: around bicentenary s - twenty - one of the average eighty kilo serious quader with , stückpreis 6 , fifty to euro . subsequently , opponents have been attended by itself 
<finished>: as a memory , but some are also in the hope of him on a reconstruction of charge . 
<finished>: thousand tonnes had rongen bought , twenty big lorry - loads . 
<finished>: around half of the store is still in the forest , and the rest is long sold . 
<finished>: gartenbesitzer , gardeners of the countryside , häuslebauer . 
<finished>: from everywhere you are , and should have been weggeschleppt what boot and supporters have come to bear . 
<finished>: the stuttgart stones have long been in " mäuerle ' turned or in restrictions on kräuterbeeten contention of . 
<finished>: " it is , in fact , this stone nothing special , ' says rongen . 
<finished>: " it would not be the political component . " 
<finished>: he is rising in his suv , makes a tour through his twenty - hectare great empire . 
<finished>: he has studied and , later , biology , then he has to be interested in computers and is , after all , steinhändler severed jura has become . 
<finished>: and steinliebhaber . 
<finished>: 40000 tonnes of bricks and mortar is to store it . 
<finished>: from the whole of germany karrt his treasures together . 
<finished>: he says that he was the biggest altsteinhändler of the republic . 
<finished>: he slows down . 
<finished>: in the snow skilful behauene sandsteine . 
<finished>: " they were once on the dresden marienbrücke ' , he tells . 
<finished>: elbsandstein , yellow , warm , he schwärmt . 
<finished>: " my lieblingsstein . " 
<finished>: it is the way high through the forest . 
<finished>: it shows on a bunch of people : the scarlet sandstein , formerly known as part of the karlsruhe first . 
<finished>: and further . 
<finished>: " pretty travertin . " 
<finished>: once included the quader on the tribune of the stuttgart neckarstadions . 
<finished>: everywhere in the snow stones and stories , cannstatter travertin from the stuttgart , rötlicher granit from the cathedral , st blasien , tuff by heilbronner hospital bringing . 
<finished>: what work , what kind of effort , which sweat . 
<finished>: if , as the stones , sooner and with simple flaschenzügen and ochsenkarren moved , he will be very ehrfürchtig have been ripped off by hand thinks rongen point . 
<finished>: " it would be a scandal if something like that quote would . " 
<finished>: the rich , he is not , has become very rich certainly are not . 
<finished>: but fourteen people steinhändler today , also have high in the forest steinmetze , a bildhauer , a , a glasbläser and a horticulturalists settled speaking of busy . 
<finished>: " we are working hard , but it is a good one , " says the resteverwerter . 
<finished>: soon , he needs to cologne . 
<finished>: there are stones to save . 
<finished>: talentekampf to high - potential 
<finished>: there is a lively surge on the buffet . 
<finished>: sixteen students are flocking to lachsbrötchen , tomatensuppe and a sweet . 
<finished>: the technical university braunschweig and volkswagen have the machinery and designstudenten to a workshop production ancillary companies invited to do so . 
<finished>: in a kind of competition of ideas , they are supposed to , along with vw developers on the car of the future , jargon - and incidentally volkswagen acquaintance . 
<finished>: in the competition for the brightest and best , many companies in the nahkampf and , as vw , on cooperation with the universities now go . 
<finished>: their mission : the most gifted graduates as early as possible in the hörsälen to recruit , before they go on the labour market and of other umworben . 
<finished>: and because the universities do not on the achievements of their students , they are trying the ausnahmetalente in praxisprojekten to erspähen and to publish lists tie . 
<finished>: on the second day of workshops on the tu braunschweig the autokonzern in order to use the talents of enlisting . 
<finished>: a young lady from the human resources departments distributed pens , gum and mappen with vw logo . 
<finished>: they told the hopeful jungtalenten of praktikumsprogrammen and studentenjobs and shows you ways in the company . 
<finished>: nico selle of the tu braunschweig cared for the project with vw . 
<finished>: he sees the benefits for both sides : ' the students enter in contact with the industry and collect experiences . " 
<finished>: " vw can , at the same time , students get to know , is an interesting candidate closer and consider , who as a staff member in question would be left . " 
<finished>: such cooperation , so selle , are not unusual . 
<finished>: newly - was that so offensive to the students gebuhlt will . 
<finished>: " otherwise , the emphasis was more on the technical project ' , says selle . 
<finished>: the fight for the fresh graduates will probably be even harder . 
<finished>: in many sectors , can the companies of their staff do not have a large throng of more from applicants to choose . 
<finished>: but they must promote and particularly to high - skilled workers balzen . 
<finished>: above all , graduates from the ingenieurdisziplinen are in excellent position . 
<finished>: according to the association of german engineers vdi remained in october over forty . thousand ingenieurstellen unfilled . 
<finished>: and the so - called ingenieurlücke will , according to vdi - forecasts become even greater . 
<finished>: for the wirtschaftsprüfungs - and consultant kpmg is novel dykta on the talentjagd . 
<finished>: he is organising events such as the kpmg - race , a kind of modern schnitzeljagd , in which the participants on the basis of gps coordinates to find their way to find - recruiting expensive . 
<finished>: eight promising students to the company , so the next year across the united states . 
<finished>: incidentally , the participants kpmg - branches to look at and the company is able to get to know . 
<finished>: those who must decide in two auswahlrunden in the run - up . 
<finished>: only the crème de la crème of the many candidates flies in the united states . 
<finished>: in the cut and thrust of the high potential of the universities will be the fight , according to dykta ever greater . 
<finished>: " we want to deal with the race from the mass withdrawal . " 
<finished>: " only a simple segeltörn was not enough for us . " 
<finished>: for talentjäger dykta the bill seems to be working . 
<finished>: " we have up until today , with all those who took part in a similar action in the last year , contact . " 
<finished>: " some are nearing completion and want to have with us ' , he says , to apply soon . 
<finished>: in addition to the direct buhlen on campus are , above all , small and medium - sized enterprises are also quite classic in berufsmessen on the pirsch . 
<finished>: " we are trying to graduates at fachmessen to achieve . " 
<finished>: " the intersolar ' sitha stübe , personalleiterin in solartechnikhersteller solarworld reported , for example on . 
<finished>: the company employs approximately one and a half thousand staff in bonn , germany . 
<finished>: stübe knows about the nachwuchsproblematik . 
<finished>: there are currently on the unternehmenswebsite 35 put out to tender . 
<finished>: " it is just very hard to vakante positions to fill . " 
<finished>: " this costs a great deal of time and money , " she says . 
<finished>: another way is the contact on the uni - professors . 
<finished>: solarworld cooperates with various universities , such as the university in freiberg . 
<finished>: " the professors to give evidence , that in my country we make or his thesis letter can work experience placements . " 
<finished>: expensive promotions are the solarspezialisten not trendy . 
<finished>: for this , the company is trying to do with other benefits for themselves , to promote : personal atmosphere , flat hierarchies and an easy communications . 
<finished>: " this can be a großkonzern often do not provide ' , says personalleiterin stübe . 
<finished>: money plays in the right of long , no longer the key role . 
<finished>: flexible working hours , childcare , or good prospects for advancement are further decisive factors . 
<finished>: in a study of the terranova great place to work institute the 55 . place among the hundred best employers documented solarworld of germany . 
<finished>: the institute produced an annual bestenliste german employers . 
<finished>: how satisfied they are with their work and their jobumfeld are and look at the framework conditions for the staff questioned it workers . 
<finished>: personalleiterin stübe hopes of the placement also plus points in the jobsuchenden . 
<finished>: " i think that candidate particularly after external evaluations on a potential employer to look " , she says . 
<finished>: wolf pure kriegler employer branding companies , with a long - term strategy is a good reputation as employers want to build up the academy of the german advises . 
<finished>: he advises his clients to more authenticity . 
<finished>: and that means , according to kriegler , especially internal measures . 
<finished>: " the best way to view themselves as employers to make it attractive , leads on its own employees ' , he says . 
<finished>: in the branchenjargon means the internal employer branding , in other words arbeitgebermarkenbildung within its own workforce . 
<finished>: " satisfied employees are the best ambassadors . " 
<finished>: if his people well and they are able to deal with the company , then you would be very of acquaintances and friends for their employers in alone identify refer to advertise . 
<finished>: " this is like a game with ties , " says kriegler . 
<finished>: obama to stop new oil drilling 
<finished>: off the coast of the united states - florida , in the gulf of mexico , it will in the coming years , no new oil drilling to give federal state . 
<finished>: such a ban has the government in washington - and , therefore , their former plans to be definitively revoked . 
<finished>: also off the atlantic coast remain new drilling for the moment , is prohibited . 
<finished>: this official said minister of the interior , ken salazar on wednesday with . 
<finished>: the trigger for the , at least for the next five years , the explosion of the deepwater horizon in april . " ' bohrplattform is supposed to apply the strict ban 
<finished>: before the accident , the eleven workers and to the biggest environmental disaster in the united states president barack obama , in response to pressure from the opposition and its new drilling in the eastern part of the gulf of mexico , the industry had led to cost the lives of a willingness to allow . 
<finished>: the supporters want to ensure that the dependence of the united states of oil supplies from abroad . 
<finished>: anyone who has the responsibility for the disastrous oil spill in the gulf , has not yet been finally resolved . 
<finished>: in the centre of the criticism is the british company bp , with milliardenforderungen will have to face . 
<finished>: a fact - finding mission on behalf of obama 's is , in the course of the dezembers their results . 
<finished>: in october , had minister of the interior , ken salazar , the following the explosion imposed bohrstopp lifted . 
<finished>: following have had several oil companies immediately applications for new bohrvorhaben asked . 
<finished>: with more stringent controls and more stringent safety regulations to obama and salazar , a new disaster . 
<finished>: at the moment the competent supervisory authority , which , according to numerous korruptionsvorwürfen into disrepute , was radically reformed . 
<finished>: at the same time , obama announced that lucrative derived from closing tax loopholes for the oil - and gaskonzerne to close it down . 
<finished>: the industry warns that the level of production in the gulf , through a more stringent regulation of markedly lower than previously , now publicly before . 
<finished>: " the government 's plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industry " , is the result of a current branchenumfrage by the consultant bdo - even before the bohrverbot of wednesday . 
<finished>: the american energy alliance has complained , moreover , the uncertainty in the industry : " no one knows what is happening with the regulation of exactly what is going to change . " 
<finished>: investment in new aid projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth . 
<finished>: ogoniland is were burnt 
<finished>: the water in the river is ölbraun , it smells like , such as in : billion litres of crude oil , the nature of the nigerian is devastating ogoniland ausgelaufenes the station . 
<finished>: the people live on theft , corruption and illegal ölkochen . 
<finished>: celestine akpobari thinks it is a good thing . 
<finished>: " you do not , reassured the ökoaktivist journalists : " today still enough oily slime before the lens wars . " you are your ' has plagued from 
<finished>: the 37 - five - year - old nigerian has the attempt to chest in water watenden young with the surrounding it schlieren abzulichten : in the regenbogenfarbenen wasserglanz , the scene is almost a persecuted , beautiful . 
<finished>: the fact that under the surface of brown rohölschwaden tops , is not to be seen . 
<finished>: earlier , have you here eimerweise prawns are collected , told esther badom on the shores of the bodo - jetty - river . 
<finished>: now is the lazy waters completely flexible dead . 
<finished>: five years ago , poured from a crude oil pipeline in the huge loads of geborstenen river wetland . 
<finished>: fishermen from the nearby städtchen bodo must now six hours fischhaltige waters in the heart of the nigerdeltas ogoniland is considered as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world , which is : in order to reach the oars just yet . 
<finished>: on the journey through the criss - crossed by along mangrovensümpfe will be the full extent of the - visible . 
<finished>: instead of shedding bright water wühlt the cause of brown wastewater on who his hand into the water , they prefer ölige finger shines out . 
<finished>: the roots of the mangrovenbäumchen as black lakritzstangen sticking out of the ground , sad let occasionally palm their wedel unbalanced depend . 
<finished>: vogelschwärme , such as they are , in fact , are : as soon as the außenborder is spreading in the as a filling station riechenden earlier paradise gespenstische calm , quiet in vain it is usual for . 
<finished>: " what is happening here , " says celestine akpobari finster : ' we live in constant danger for the health , environmental warfare is . " 
<finished>: the kriegsvergleich is appropriate . 
<finished>: the residential areas of the ogoni people is a battlefield : here more than sixty years ago , the first from europe , here in the eighties - years with writer ken saro - wiwa , the first of the resistance , here the shell corporation 1993 his cease production , because it for its ölarbeiter too dangerous has been had to exekutierten the later is organised explorateure before people claiming to be controversial for decades . 
<finished>: still , today , is the following : from the whole of the delta region of the triple the size of switzerland and miles of pipelines on a daily basis , more than two million barrels of the black gold is pumped into the oil fields in the ogoniland broke , too unstable to the corporation to keep the situation are , it is with about five thousand bohrquellen during ogoniland denied the company the return . 
<finished>: every few hundred metres sticking stählerne gestelle as bizarre sculptures from the water : " christbäumchen ' will be the heads of the bohrlöcher much to zärtlich mentioned . 
<finished>: they are up to fifty years old , the most to the mark korrodiert . 
<finished>: again and again breche bohrkopf thinks akpobari , then rinne a constant stream of crude oil into the water , such a deal . 
<finished>: more than two billion litres expertenschätzungen in fifty years ago into the ecosystem of the delta : year after year , the amount of oil , as it did in the wreck of the ' exxon valdez ' twenty years before one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind , drive into the sea alaska supertankers poured in after are . 
<finished>: anyone who is in favour of the continued eco - case scenario is to blame , it will be a subject of disagreement . 
<finished>: during the shell and the organised öldiebstahl for more than ninety per cent of the pollution environmentalists berstende bohrköpfe and leaky pipelines , as one of the main perpetrators see power , responsible sabotage of the company . 
<finished>: shell in nigeria , and much lower standards of safety than would otherwise have been in the world , the usual practice of the us - scientists richard steiner 2008 before : the rate of incidents in the pipes , was " many times higher than elsewhere " alone , the company raised attach . 
<finished>: in one place , from the distant as a deserted , ölverschmierte workshop , seeping from the mangroven : they are splitternackt and up to the neck got covered in oil on shape , then there is . 
<finished>: under one of the many fässer , with tubes tied , part of an arbitrary scattered on the site , a fire : an illegal kleinraffinerie flackert spot are part of the . 
<finished>: in barriques will be the price of crude oil on the fire , michael , the head of the group said several hours while . 
<finished>: first of all petrol through the pipes in the auffangtopf , later spits a little at the end of the leadership of kerosene , and , finally , diesel gets out . 
<finished>: to produce it in such a way , michael and four members of staff on a daily basis , up to four fässer diesel à 300 litre : ' this will bring us a ' - around 22 dollars . naira thousand 34 . 
<finished>: the deltabewohner to take advantage of the chronic treibstoffknappheit in the biggest erdölstaat saharan africa . 
<finished>: nigeria has only about a single refinery . 
<finished>: the euro - cent per litre ridiculously low price of diesel oil , can the illegal stoves still : because their raw material they get undercut forty with barely in vain . 
<finished>: he comes from " bunkerern ' pipeline network : the country , according to experts in the whole of the niger delta on a daily basis at least sixteen million litres of crude oil lost . go this way to right the way across the ogoniland dipping into 
<finished>: only a tiny part of the raw material is illegal , however , old - fashioned methods : the lion 's share of organised criminal networks , politicians and high - ranking military officers should belong in tankers and sell off him on the world market , too , to which fill zwischengelagerten provisionally . 
<finished>: the debate as to whether the environmental disaster of the population or the lax , does the activist akpobari for purely academic is due to production methods , in particular , more like . 
<finished>: " if the oil companies are not as they should have the livelihood of the fishermen , there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries . " destroyed not so thoroughly and perceived to be intruders 
<finished>: now is the relationship of the ogoni people , above all , to shell , but that only a withdrawal of the group : " other nationalities , such as the chinese , as a better . " yes , perhaps , is to ask would be destroyed so 
<finished>: there is michael nervous . 
<finished>: " it is high time that their disappears , ' says the muskulöse ölmann . 
<finished>: " every minute , can the soldiers to come . " 
<finished>: will the illegal ölveredler of the special forces , although no arrest , but a painful schmiergeld you caught threatens . 
<finished>: also , the mainly from the landesnorden soldiers want - as all nigerians - of the raw material originating from . 
<finished>: " this stuff is for our country , in every respect , the dog ' , says akpobari hell .

<finished>: now , as the then mayoress relatives and friends with an act of remembrance to the dead . 
<finished>: tens of thousands of people had gathered in the sunshine in greymouth on the new zealand südinsel radioactive gathered . 
<finished>: two minutes long , you remained silent .

<finished>: the suits splatter kunstkino ? 
<finished>: the director nicolas winding refn lotet with his fighters - manas ' walhalla rising ' old genre - borders newly from . 
<finished>: in what may be the danish director nicolas winding refn , as he " walhalla rising ' films have thought audience has ? 
<finished>: a prisoner - with only one eye ( mads mikkelsen ) freed themselves from his peinigern übermenschlichen forces his opponents , ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action , it is precisely because our hero like rough to kill his enemies gedärme from the if he bad mood . , vibrant limb length of the time already served and sounds multitudes in order - almost , and sets out with fighters boats produced 
<finished>: on the other hand , says einauge , as it is actually the whole film about a word , and also the other characters are a maximum of about one or two sentences or a few painful todesschreien time , will be called . 
<finished>: otherwise , it is in the gruselig fine hügellandschaft scotland geschwelgt , the wikingerwelt from around a thousand years ago , the scene offers and silent . 
<finished>: ideal for adults with interest for existentialismus and very calm kamerafahrten cineasten . 
<finished>: well , if a film is a number of target , but it is a shame that , if you have are mutually exclusive . 
<finished>: director winding refn his wild and gestylten drug dealers - trilogy " pusher ' as a kind of danish version of quentin tarantino stoisch , his works with a little more sense of humour to the mainstream , or a little less brutality of the arthouse , however , is refusing to do so , since it applies to make it accessible to all . 
<finished>: the majority of kunstkino - friends of the around spritzenden gehirnmasse and the gedärmen deterred is likely . 
<finished>: the action - sports fans die at the latest , if einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons , with a force of violent christian missionaries via jerusalem and an eternity in the doldrums and fog feststeckt , before the team , it would seem that in america , and continue to remain silent makes ship after , then from boredom . 
<finished>: it is no wonder , then , that " walhalla rising ' in germany , is no cinema - renting out found only on dvd , and has now appeared . 
<finished>: this is particularly due to the magnificent images of a crying shame , but also because , behind the façade of a sometimes exciting piece of cinema is hiding something , the attention has earned bluttriefenden grandiose until . 
<finished>: in this film , it is not about human rights dialogues or a stringent act , it is all atmosphere , a filmgewordener fiebertraum . 
<finished>: and from the there is for the viewer , no means of escape . 
<finished>: he is hardly a moment of relaxation and him with his icy images and the dark blossom - artigen soundtrack very slowly , but , above all , with the incomprehensible hatred , the it for the heart of the characters to the throats of motion refusing refn ; . 
<finished>: only a small blonder young , the faithful to the side , as all the others will of innocence , such a thing is preserved einauge anger driven . 
<finished>: the one - eyed man hero , whose motives are never to be explained , the enemies and allies , at some point the fighters from the hell , ambassador of the devil himself may temporarily , but for the vast majority of the time . 
<finished>: it means a road to ruin , perhaps , but also just for the already blighted . 
<finished>: " walhalla rising ' is a rätselhafter film , you have to hate them and admire the angry , get and wonder . 
<finished>: a thrill . 
<finished>: suspicious erdarbeiten 
<finished>: the international atomic energy agency iaea has new evidence on a secret nuclear programme in syria . 
<finished>: the country is , however , to take a view on this - is still makes it controls . 
<finished>: the fifth on the 6 . at least four israeli fighter planes a mysteriöses , würfelförmiges buildings in syria to i f - fifteen resort in september at midnight against . 
<finished>: it is on the edge of the euphrates ; the next major city , thirty kilometres away , is dair as - saur . 
<finished>: her name comes up in the documents of the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) , when it comes to the syria allegedly with help from north korea in the quader has built , hidden in a valley of the electricity , the reactor is displayed . 
<finished>: according to a briefing of the cia at the end of april 2008 would be the name of the middle village of el - kibar reactor , plutonium to produce - from the building nuclear weapons have been well - suited authentic the also under auslandsgeheimdienstes us - are at risk . 
<finished>: for other purposes against rotten the technology from the 1950s hardly . 
<finished>: the cia has led a videopräsentation before with by means of fuzzy be . 
<finished>: by computeranimation blendete , where what components of the reactor before the destruction of a copy of the north korean model from the atomzentrum yongbyon verkleinerte , have been intended to be a , you should be . 
<finished>: in addition , it presented photographs , the buildings in the vicinity show , or even the innenraum . 
<finished>: the reactor was just before the start of operation , it said , but not yet with pellets peppers have been stood up . 
<finished>: today , more than three years after the bombing , is a little more aware than it was then , yes , the mystery has been with the passing of time , rather than greater . 
<finished>: the former us president george w. bush , has recently been in his memoirs that the cia before the attack was , of course , that syria in el - kibar a reactor built , but hardly evidence that it will be in the country , " an active nuclear ' saw right , although revealed there were . 
<finished>: some geheimdienstler in europe , there are more cautious and are only talking about a ' alleged reactor ' , even if they are the cia presentation for ' plausible " still prefer to keep . 
<finished>: they lack of hard evidence , as well as the iaea . 
<finished>: asked how sure he was that a reactor , a un diplomat in the summer only , the iaea was " enough material to ask questions , " bluntly high to have replied , before . 
<finished>: the debris of the so - called ' dormant militärgebäudes ' the syrians is eager to one side and planierten the terrain of thoroughly the vessel . 
<finished>: however , took place in a team under the previous chief inspector olli heinonen in el - kibar traces of uranium , which is produced by people - june 2008 iaea had been . 
<finished>: in addition , the iaea on a member state satellite pictures of commercial service providers from the period immediately after the attack , the more meaningful than by the cia are likely to be presented . 
<finished>: these , however , are on the market , not because of the unknown entities - perhaps israel - it exclusively , to get photographs has bought . 
<finished>: the iaea cannot , therefore , their authenticity of do not independently verify . 
<finished>: syria has always claimed that has never been a secret nuclear programme farms or a reactor built to have . 
<finished>: the uranium come from the israeli weapons , said damascus . 
<finished>: but the iaea after analysis of the particles as unlikely pointed out back . 
<finished>: since then , refuses to damascus to discuss - as well as on the satellite pictures . 
<finished>: in addition , the inspectors a second inspection in el - kibar and access to the ruins of the zerbombten building it denied . 
<finished>: but israel has remained silent pugnaciously . 
<finished>: " we will never comment on ' at the time of the attack , president - in - office premier ehud olmert , the official position of the recently , confirmed . 
<finished>: so the investigation since june 2008 ' is becoming a serious problem of credibility for the authority " , such as a western diplomat at the headquarters of the iaea in vienna - a serious breach of the non - proliferation treaty in the area , on which the iaea is to legitimise the finally high and would not give out if dragging the body . 
<finished>: as a key to progress in the enlightenment , which provides for the iaea appears to three other bodies , and the ' in functional link ' with the alleged reactor - and , unlike this still exist are supposed to be . 
<finished>: the inspectors have not yet disclosed what plants , even you have or what you seem suspicious leaves the function of what it is doing . 
<finished>: according to the information provided by the süddeutsche zeitung , they will be in the iaea internally as marj - sultan , masyaf and iskandariayah , which are derived from nearby towns , in turn , referred to as well . 
<finished>: the independent institute for science and international security in washington ( isis ) has these places are identified and on a structure , in which it is likely to be one of the suspects objects made in masyaf be picked . 
<finished>: it is perhaps in or immediately , in addition to a military base , denied access to syria to the iaea , the three places . explanatory statement with precisely this 
<finished>: in vienna , the syrians were fearful of a fishing expedition - that the iaea from the united states will have to take in order to publicise vorgeschickt it means disappearance . 
<finished>: because the nukleardetektive were by a tip of the us intelligence services on the institutions . 
<finished>: the iaea has evidence , including satellite photographs , that between the three places and the quader on the euphrates material - and has been . 
<finished>: a high western diplomat in vienna said that at least one of the plants could " in connection with the fuel production " . 
<finished>: there is , however , ' no references to sensitive activities ' , in other words , uranium enrichment or reprocessing ; processes , the construction of nuclear weapons are necessary . 
<finished>: the type of reactor will be with uranium , which is not indefinite . 
<finished>: but where the uranium and plutonium for the time - bomb waiting to be cut off , on these central issues , there is nothing any plausible assumptions should the later where it would have meant . 
<finished>: it is also unclear whether the debris , the valuable traces mountains could , in the course of the three places were stored . 
<finished>: it is as if the hundreds during which trailers , nobody wants to have any information as to where the debris remained , disappeared from the ground is . 
<finished>: the only a few kilometres from el - kibar on the other side of the euphrates salzmine al - tibni , the syria 1998 on their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste has investigated , the iaea as unlikely to . 
<finished>: the former iaea inspector robert kelley they had been in a recent analysis of the well - known magazine jane ' s intelligence review with the reactor in connection to be made . 
<finished>: recordings from the show , however , that syria to the three suspects places erdarbeiten and great containers , after the iaea access had requested of remote coincided orbit . 
<finished>: this can be a coincidence , but hardly helped , the suspicion . 
<finished>: in addition , it says , in diplomatic circles , the iaea issued a number of months , a plan for inspections there to develop , it should be possible to preserve the tape shows how much interest the inspectors is alone militärgeheimnisse syria allow used to have . 
<finished>: however , damascus bügelte also this proposal . 
<finished>: western diplomats in vienna , still a year ago , the reactor is destroyed , the matter of urgency around us ambassador glyn davies since a couple of months ago , so - called special inspections , one of the harshest funds , the vienna atombehörde has , in order to control the game into brings no high , have , therefore , was to appease had to impose . 
<finished>: iaea chief yukiya amano , these inspections should propose , of a " option , for which i am open in the future ' , but even he hesitates to already has , it is true . 
<finished>: it is a high risk in this way : on the one hand , there needs to be a majority in governors of the iaea , and many of the represented 35 countries are anything other than eager for an escalation . 
<finished>: on the other hand , as a diplomat to have concerns : " what if it is at the end of nothing at all ? " 
<finished>: love in the time of the war 
<finished>: since angelina jolie in the summer with the work on her still nameless regiedebüt has begun , there will be trouble . 
<finished>: the script has been written , a love story between a woman from bosnia , and a serbian itself you man . 
<finished>: we know a lot more about non - but even that will be enough for the unrest . 
<finished>: the rumour , the woman , a muslim , verliebe during the yugoslavia war in their serbian rapist is stubbornly persisting . 
<finished>: bosnian women 's associations have immediately protested in sarajevo planned drehtage in the short term , according to some , whereupon hungary . 
<finished>: in the meantime , the film in hungary and in the post - production , but it will still be protested in bosnia to . 
<finished>: bakira hasecic from the organization of the united nations high commission for refugees ( unhcr jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress , has a bosnian newspaper now reported - jolie is even as ambassador to the united nations - to on female victims wrote a separate . 
<finished>: in diplomatic terms , it is not the women before a meeting in hungary offered , but what the time weeks already has - it rejected . 
<finished>: the meeting must take the lead in bosnia , so hasecic . 
<finished>: liebesgeschichten in vergewaltigungscamps did not exist , and jolies attitude towards the victims would not be betraying their enough on the script . 
<finished>: their organisation has the un - recommended , jolie as ambassador to dismiss them , the guardian reported , according to the organisation . 
<finished>: what exactly but has jolie for scenes written ? 
<finished>: the bosnian ministry of culture , the script to read has after a drehgenehmigung to sarajevo , it is not quite clear why jolie then , nevertheless , not - given since and some out , her dance . 
<finished>: the jungautorin itself , not political intentions with their film , with a great deal of effort in the conflict , the terrible consequences of the war and all the interested parties to give a voice to show wants to yugoslavia - incorporated themselves to have watched , they asserted . 
<finished>: the content is , however , you are vague . 
<finished>: so even a second synopsis to film in the network , which will then be quite different sounds : the loving before and , as you , a bosnian muslim , in a serbian camp is being hijacked , in which he , as a guard working back meeting is already knew of it war has been circulating . 
<finished>: what is , of course , but significantly different sounds as the " rape victims verknallt variant in torturer ' . 
<finished>: that jolies film , in fact , even before the end of the war begins - that much is certain . 
<finished>: the pressure on you , so jolie , was " unfair and is based on misinformation . " 
<finished>: now even the hackers of hollywood peace : the script , as has been the case so many before , illegally into the network you give by only can her well . 
<finished>: nothing like path here 
<finished>: this evening , it is finally time for the irish , right again around runs .

<finished>: after a decade of the recovery , which is for the irish , great wealth , power is now once again conceded . 
<finished>: the economic crisis has shaken this , above all , the young , well - educated , irish , for which there is , so far , only going up . 
<finished>: jobverlust and social decline seemed in the boom years , absurd . 
<finished>: every was needed , the money was there in abundance . 
<finished>: in the meantime , however , there are three out of ten women and men under the age of thirty , without work . 
<finished>: in the irish times there are leserbriefe young emigrants , the complaints : " everything is in ireland , the bach drops . many '

<finished>: the demokatrische routine 
<finished>: the pro - democracy movement in latin america is stronger , so as the support of private companies . 
<finished>: crime is a bigger problem than the unemployment rate . 
<finished>: in many parts of the region is the influence of brazil 's larger than that of the united states . 
<finished>: these results came the latinobarómetro survey , which in eighteen countries carried out and exclusively in the economist has been published . 
<finished>: this survey is being carried out on a regular basis , and so the favour in this region on shows since then . 
<finished>: two facts of this year 's survey , carried out by the september and october , particularly in ' s an eye in the fall . 
<finished>: firstly , the good mood in latin america 
<finished>: and secondly , in view of the growing interest in democracy , and their most important institutions . 
<finished>: in many countries of the south american has taken the democratic movement has grown considerably ( s . league table one ) . 
<finished>: in peru , where the economy has been 2002 every year in order to approximately 6 % of the number of by forty per cent in 2005 to sixty - one percent this year while , rose is growing . z . b . 
<finished>: also in mexico , where the economy has been the strong slump last year recovered , is such a trend to see . 
<finished>: but only half of those polled in mexico and brazil , the most populous countries in the region , are convinced democrats , with regard to the regional average reduces ( s . graph b ) . 
<finished>: forty - four per cent of those polled said that they are with the democratic practice of their country to be satisfied . these are , as happened last year , however , 25 % more than in the year 2001 ( graph three ) so . around . 
<finished>: thirty - four per cent of the confidence of the congress of their country and 45 % of their government , both of which in the last year , but a sharp increase from 2003 ( seventeen per cent or show meet values around 24 % ) . 
<finished>: a decade ago , latin america is the economic crises in the efforts to achieve more democracy 's initiative . 
<finished>: also during the global economic crisis , is that the countries of latin america only a brief recession saw and quickly recovered have reminded may tinker with this the . 
<finished>: in addition , the poor by a stronger safety net propped up . 
<finished>: ( according to reports of the un economic commission for latin america this week 2009 the poverty rate in latin america , only slightly , and is once again this year to % fallen rose . ) 
<finished>: but from country to country , there are strong stimmungsunterschiede ( s . graph 4 ) . 
<finished>: brazil 's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing president luiz inácio lula da silva is reflected in a widespread fortschrittsdenken . 
<finished>: in mexico and central america , where the recession was more tangible and violent crime has increased , it is less the case . 
<finished>: it was only the second time since umfragebeginn see many respondents in latin america in the crime in their country a bigger problem than it is in the unemployment ( s . graph five ) . 
<finished>: around . % say that either they or a family member in the last year , victims of crime have been 38 % in the last year , are the values have fallen and achieve , therefore , the lowest level since then , with . but , from 31 . 
<finished>: the rising economic output is reflected in the support of the private sector - and the market economy around . % of respondents at cross - regional level , that the private sector for the development of the eu is essential , in the year 2007 56 % ( s . graph 6 ) it was to gave 71 : stronger . 
<finished>: around 58 % declared that only the market economy your country progress compared with 47 % in the last year , can bring . 
<finished>: sixty percent of those polled in venezuela , this view is maintained ( are ) , left - wing president , hugo chávez , many private companies were nationalised twice during her , although for a private sector % and eighty have interesting . 
<finished>: nineteen percent of the respondents ( last year ) , the largest weight in the region , followed by the united states ( unchanged ) and venezuela ( nine percent compared with eleven % last year ) , a year since last nine percent , in the eighteenth % according to brazil has . 
<finished>: the respondents were in mexico , and the majority of the countries of central america , however , the united states , the most influential role in the dominican republic and venezuela , nicaragua from this country , in seeing will be accepted . 
<finished>: a wahlschlappe 
<finished>: no one had expected that the elections to be held on november in haiti . be perfect . 
<finished>: but the facts of the developing countries exceeded the fears of poll workers , the beleaguered country to help wolf , by far . 
<finished>: overcrowded ballot boxes , on several occasions , in polling stations and acts of intimidation were only a part of the problems have been destroyed , poll rinnstein votes . 
<finished>: polling stations opened up with stundenlanger late . 
<finished>: many haitians , many of whom are from the earthquake in january had become , streiften injured in search of a displaced choice . 
<finished>: some gave , finally , to be totally . 
<finished>: a dozen presidential candidates , including some suspected tops the list , because of alleged fraud , the lifting of the required results . 
<finished>: in the whole of the country , there was some violent protests . 
<finished>: however , edmond mulet , the head of the un mission in haiti , the election " as a right good in many respects , described " . 
<finished>: according to observers of the organisation of american states and the caribbean these irregularities , so serious that they may be , the process is not necessarily make community " null and void " from a cautious statement . 
<finished>: in other words , the show goes on . 
<finished>: the , the outgoing president rené préval 's and his candidates , a jew célestin , is obliged , will the preliminary results on the seventh of december unloved allegedly has the opportunity to announce . 
<finished>: the expected run - off is scheduled for january . 
<finished>: there are still some hope in the election . 
<finished>: the two leading opposition candidate , the rap musicians michel martelly and the former first - lady mirlande manigat , have their initial ungültigkeitsklage withdrawn . 
<finished>: if a jew célestin , with most of the voters only low or even by the winner of the run - off , he declared , this could lead to problems for wahlberhörde , will not be approved . 
<finished>: because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than a million of the victims of the earthquake are still living in tents , was a low turnout fears . 
<finished>: on the day of the election , many haitians by lack of organisation on the vote . 
<finished>: shortly before wahlbeginn . 250 . thousand identity cards , the election will be needed , not yet around were distributed . 
<finished>: there is a great deal at stake . 
<finished>: the donor countries look a legitimate , as an important step forward in the reconstruction of haiti 's government recognised . 
<finished>: the haitians themselves are of the same opinion . 
<finished>: secretly in the middle 
<finished>: in the weeks after the sudden death of her husband 's argentina 's president , cristina fernández , a wave of sympathy , the their beliebtheitsrate to twenty points over fifty . this is the highest value since its election year in queues % upwards was told . 
<finished>: this , however , in the next year to a re - election depends on whether trauernde cristina fernández kompromissbereiter her husband , her predecessor and political partners néstor kirchner . late is as visibly , grants her whether the 
<finished>: the sign is not clear . 
<finished>: kirchner , even after the election , his wife , the economic policy , budgets , the economic growth and inflation are not fully recognised . tax revenue , the often drew was néstor 
<finished>: this allowed it to the präsidentenpaar , the extraeinnahmen at its own discretion to spend . 
<finished>: on paper , lost the fernández - government last year , the majority in congress . 
<finished>: but the opposition is divided and kirchners death after a heart attack on october led to further . divisions . 
<finished>: some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling peronisten were behind cristina fernández . 
<finished>: but after chaotic meetings ( in which a parliamentarian , a different face to face and others , the government has succeeded in the congress not to cut the budget for 2011 ) of bribery were proposed to adopt . 
<finished>: " i will not discuss ' , so the president . 
<finished>: the budget for the next year , which the president even more opportunity , money has also 2010 is now at its own discretion to spend . 
<finished>: the economy is running hot : it is likely that we will be having this year by up to nine percent grow . 
<finished>: the official rate of inflation is z . % , but many private estimates - and the trade unions - drive the value of almost thirty percent of wage moderation , in eleven z . . 
<finished>: kirchner , the office of economic growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives , and not the inflationssenkung said , was shaken argentina , as the took over . 
<finished>: he refused the cooperation with the imf , has singled out for bullying as his in the private sector and the national institute of statistics and census indec , which then has the official inflationsstatistiken säuberte schönte . 
<finished>: now , we can fernández path ? 
<finished>: it has called on the private sector and the trade union leaders , to the talks has been called . 
<finished>: and , according to official statements to wage increases in the next year to eighteen percent should be limited . 
<finished>: the high prices for argentina 's agricultural products that have brought the economy to a strong boost . 
<finished>: but the inflation book the spurt with a great devaluation in the year . 
<finished>: perhaps wish to cristina fernández , for this reason , argentina in terms to the rest of the world to join in again . 
<finished>: at the beginning of this year , met the government to reach an agreement with the former debt restructuring of the country in the year 2001 shareholders holding had rejected . 
<finished>: now it seems that fernández on an agreement with the donors from the paris club , to push them around . $ 6 billion owed . 
<finished>: the kirchners had a review by the imf , as elsewhere , the usual practice is always rejected . 
<finished>: but in the last month was amado boudou known , that the establishment of a new national index of consumer prices ' technical support ' . it looks as if this is the first step to clean up the indec will make in the finance ministers of the fund . 
<finished>: it is not known whether mr fernández after the end of its term of office , even without the support of their husband , politically active will be . 
<finished>: if so , it needs to get the support of the middle class , for the most part has enough by the kirchnerismus . 
<finished>: if the argentinians in march from their summer holiday , will return to the wave of sympatie , of which it has been shown , abgeebbt . 
<finished>: if you have a further choice would like to win , they must decide whether they are many of the political decisions of their man quietly and suspends . 
<finished>: weak applause for china 
<finished>: taiwan 's voters are coming closer to slow a closer link with the mainland . 
<finished>: what does taiwan by its big brother beyond the strait ? 
<finished>: in november , more than seven and a half million voters are seventy per cent of all voters , in the city 's mayor , and this will be as broad assessment of president ma ying - jeou . councillors were free to choose five to , in order that , in itself , as was seen . 
<finished>: by building a cutting - edge einschl . free trade agreement , is itself a symbol for the relations with the continent has the relationship with the chinese mainland for the first time since 1949 sustainable policy . its ma of a partial business has changed . 
<finished>: ma has the test , but only barely . 
<finished>: although his kuomintang party ( kmt ) , three of the five , the mayor is , it received no majority . 
<finished>: instead , the democratic progressive party ( dpp ) , which has a greater independence for taiwan , almost fifty per cent of the vote , the kmt received 45 advocates % . 
<finished>: in a presidential election , and it could have been for ma problems means . 
<finished>: since his election two years ago , is the share of his party around eight percent . 
<finished>: for the first time , withdrew the dpp even , together with the kmt in the city . 
<finished>: during the election , there was the usual as lastwagenkonvois with krawallmachern , flags of convenience - schwenkende massenumzüge and only a few incidents , in taiwan was dancers . 
<finished>: there were even the compulsory , mysterious mordversuch . 
<finished>: sean lien instrument , the son of lien instrument chan and honorary president of the kmt felt on the eve of the election , giving a speech on a kmt - candidates , 
<finished>: as for him to be a man from the amount of lien instrument was wounded and a umstehender . in the face of fence , viewers were killed . 
<finished>: it is not clear whether the save lien instrument to kill or a dispute with the candidates settle bizarrerweiser wanted . 
<finished>: regardless of the attack , according to tsai ing - wen , the leader of the dpp , the election and the dpp in a bad light , which is what the kmt brought more votes has brought us . 
<finished>: perhaps it was china , the biggest winners of the campaign . 
<finished>: it is significant that it was the relationship with the mainland . 
<finished>: instead , debated the candidates on plans to housing and the creation of jobs . 
<finished>: the taiwanese love their de facto independence , and we reject china 's militärbedrohung . 
<finished>: it is for this reason the kmt their relations with the government in beijing is not happy to be in the forefront . 
<finished>: but this time , too , the dpp , the anti - chinese sentiment to very upsetting to floods . 
<finished>: on the new awareness that taiwan 's economy without china , will not be able to survive so that they responded . 
<finished>: ma , for its part , would like to confirm that the majority of the taiwanese his china - let policy advocates . 
<finished>: the government in beijing , will be to continue to pursue its strategy , taiwan , with economic incentives in the community zurückzulocken . 
<finished>: china sent immediately to a negotiator after taipei , for a summit to investment and medical cooperation . 
<finished>: certainly , it also wants to see a political integration , but the most important thing first of all . 
<finished>: it is waiting to prefer until after the presidential elections 2012 . 
<finished>: the dpp has now re - invented . 
<finished>: two years ago , it was seriously weakened : the former party leader , chen shui - bian was due to corruption in the prison . 
<finished>: during its presidency , of 2008 he vehemently in favour of the complete independence came to a . 
<finished>: but under tais year reign of a new generation of politicians and the dpp is struggling for the votes of the professionals , and the youth gemässigter developed . 
<finished>: as a presidential candidate , such as su tseng - chang under chen . approval dpp tsai was the great 
<finished>: their party is doing everything now , in order to show that it is also in a position to have close relations with beijing . 
<finished>: tsai is planning a think tank , as a point of contact between the dpp and china . this , however , presupposes vorurteilsfreie discussions ahead of us . 
<finished>: tsai said publicly that their party a " trusted alternative " offer to mas cutting closer to china . 
<finished>: chen appears on this change very angry about that . 
<finished>: from his cell from , he said the candidates of the dpp would have done better to taiwan independence to exist . 
<finished>: he urged the pragmatist su even on , on the incumbent . 
<finished>: even without chens interference is doing the dpp difficult , their possible candidates to choose . 
<finished>: the kmt will of their own self - analysis have to undertake . 
<finished>: mas values are bad , in spite of the rapid economic growth ; the kmt - candidates wanted their campaign without him . 
<finished>: the main reasons for his unpopularity overseas is taken seem to unemployment and the ever more gap between the rich and the poor . 
<finished>: according to a statement by a spokesman , he will be the cabinet , as well as the local institutions kmt transform . 
<finished>: the strong presence of the dpp suggests that taiwan is a rapprochement only limited support . 
<finished>: at the same time , to see the majority of taiwanese , economic cooperation with china as inevitable . 
<finished>: according to antonio chiang , a prominent columnists , " there are already a point of no return ' .

<finished>: arsenic - resistant mikrobe could new forms of life on the earth or elsewhere to enable 
<finished>: the discovery of a foreign bakterienart , the u . of arsenic , opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on earth , and can live a . elsewhere . 
<finished>: although scientists this unusual bacteria here on earth , it is their view , a sign that a life without the date as possible is elements deemed vital discovered . 
<finished>: " this organism has two options . " 
<finished>: " he needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic . " 
<finished>: " this is what makes it , although it is almost a kind of ' foreign ' way of life ' , said paul davies of the arizona state university and co - author of the report , on thursday in the online edition of the journal science seems to be the . c . w is particularly to be something very . 
<finished>: so far as carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and sulphur - treated , there have been six key elements are vital . 
<finished>: but , as the scientists herausfanden , is growing the bacteria in the californian mono lake also then even further , if there is phosphorous by arsenic replaced . 
<finished>: " this begs the question of what is possible , " said the co - author of the report , ariel from the arizona state university anbar d . yet but , otherwise . 
<finished>: the discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem life , as scientists live and his forms , we need to realise that so anbar . 
<finished>: the study has been carried out with microbes on earth have been found . 
<finished>: the announcement of a press conference , in which there is no details to the discovery , gave rise to speculation on the internet that the report by the discovery of außerirdischen life act , could spread far were announced . 
<finished>: this is not the case . 
<finished>: the discovery " demonstrates that in other organisms , with the help of other elements of biochemical processes and ' , which , in our view , absolutely not , " said charles cockell , professor at the sciences research institute of the university of milton keynes , in the united kingdom . open space planetary and are absolutely , firmly set , which are vital to standardelemente can set in motion that the ' planetensystemen 
<finished>: cockel was not part of the research teams . 
<finished>: " this work is a first of its kind , because it shows that , in the basic processes and structures one element by another can be replaced , " added cockell bio - added . 
<finished>: this discovery was not by chance . 
<finished>: felisa wolfe - simon of astrobiologischen institute of nasa , the study of the lake because of the high arsengehalts mono led , chose . 
<finished>: since arsenic and phosphorus chemically similar to that microbes , the two are exposed to , perhaps an element of by the other can replace them , took . 
<finished>: " the toxicity of the arsens is based above all on the fact that it is chemically similar to the case , as phosphorus . " 
<finished>: " it 's hard to be an element of the other to distinguish organisms that . " 
<finished>: " but the difference is so great that the arsenic than phosphorus . it is our system , where it all ' , says anbar verschmiert almost biochemisches arrived at in works differently . 
<finished>: the researchers set the bacterium gfaj - one of a rising arsenkonzentration . it suited to and grew . 
<finished>: the growing better , but that they are also in the case of arsenic , arsenic - based way of life , of course , on the face of the earth or another planet or moon , on the arsenic in either can occur , a show that can survive phosphorus mikrobe in more and more frequent occurrence . 
<finished>: according to jamie foster , dozentin for microbiology at the university of florida , is the idea that , by means of arsenic can be replaced , not new . however , so far there has been no functioning phosphorus . s example . 
<finished>: arsenic was more often , she says , is why the science on the assumption that early life forms it before , in the early erdjahren have used . 
<finished>: " this is something that gives reason to believe that life is different , too , have developed in early forster , wolfe - simon 's not a member in the ' , and rightly so , as can all was . 
<finished>: the research by the department of energy and the national health authorities , the nasa supports .

<finished>: the justice department wanted to address the case not to speak out . 
<finished>: the judgment was for many of the ethics - lawyers outside the ministry of justice as something of a surprise . in their view , there was sufficient evidence that ensign lobbying - ban has disregarded . 
<finished>: interviews , e - mails and other documents , for the first time in october , the new york times , the ensign douglas hampton , one of his election agent , to lucrative contracts , in order to be silent on a hamptons wife cynthia to affair with helped make that assumption , gave rise to have been laid bare in 2009 buy . 
<finished>: cynthia hampton was during an election campaign ensigns as treasurer . 
<finished>: ensign took contact on some political friends on , in order to work , according to the records , and he assumed for you after the attitude hamptons lobbying interrogation . hampton to give . 
<finished>: since hampton in ensigns wahlteam was , it was he a year lobbying for his former employer or the whole of the senate to take no pleasure for yet more recently . 
<finished>: according to the statement of the unusual agreement between ensign and hampton , chummy , were against the so - called prohibition of drehtür - lobbykratie . affair before the breached ethics experts 
<finished>: according to the published evidence " , it is an agreement that has been reached and to the violation of the drehtür - stanley fire , a washington lawyer , which is based on the defence of clients of specialised in the sights of the government are so statutes ' to all appearances . 
<finished>: while the justice department , the reasons for the decision in the case , said fire and other ethikanwälten very careful in the political charges after a large number of defeats , the media have been in the last year , the charges against the former senator ted stevens because of misconduct on the part of the public prosecutor 's office decision , including the following with great interest of the fall to include notes , the ministry . to give ensign known rejected it officially - let . 
<finished>: prosecutors ' are obviously schreckhaft melanie sloan , the chairman of the association , " ethics in washington " ( an organisation whose purpose , the fight against corruption in government circles of the united states is ) , a group of lawyers , the various charges against . ensign brought before the courts has - and parliament - and citizens for responsibility said , " .

<finished>: ensigns defender had with the prosecutors , in order to convince them that the senator 's office , in a statement on wednesday , once again repeated , " in accordance with the law " have to be , as cooperating . - . 
<finished>: coggins refused , the legal arguments , which he compared to the prosecutors put forward to explain in more detail . - . 
<finished>: " to me , it is not in the gesprächsdetails between the ministry and me to go . let me just say this : we believe that the right decision to have , " said he said was , arguably , in this . 
<finished>: last month , the bundeswahlkommission decided that the investigation because of a separate complaint by the ethics committee , after the payment of $ 96 , thousand of parents to the hamptons against the bundeswahlgesetz . ensigns - . 
<finished>: the electoral commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money is to be anything other than a gift . 
<finished>: nv energy , a large company in nevada , which has for a long time the senator supported , was one of the firms , which are in hampton , thanks to the assistance of ensign lobbyists - work - . - took place . 
<finished>: an e - mail dated december 2008 proves that , after the company as a lobbyist , chief of staff , john lopez , a conversation with hampton had , in which he called for him and said that he was in the ministry of the interior , because of a thing " anklopfe ' . . - ensings has got - hampton - . 
<finished>: ensign with hampton and one other customers from nevada , allegiant for lunch and asked the minister of transport , a meeting on behalf of the airline , to reconcile , after this . hampton to lobbying stopped . - agreed air . - was also - . 
<finished>: as last year , for the first time , information on this affair to the public , is in his constituents and his position in the senate , where he was in the order of precedence of the republicans in fourth place to be was ensign apologize - people claiming to be .

<finished>: in the announcement , that is no longer the objective of police investigations , said his pressesprecherin , cooper , the senator hope that the ethics committee very quickly to the example of the ministry of justice and its investigation einstelle . : ensign - .

<finished>: cheshire - appeal power on twitter attention 
<finished>: a half - dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom way . 
<finished>: in the minutentakt verschickten you on twitter for their reports on the appalling testimonies . 
<finished>: at the end , so the defence , there have been more than forty thousand twitter - news about the process in order to rape and to beds gekettete children in a house , the flare - up . . 
<finished>: on thursday , the process of steven j. hayes , the three members of a family from cheshire , connecticut , killed , an official at the end of the sentence , on the death sentence , the jury has spoken in favour , if found , have to fall , charged was followed closely . 
<finished>: but lawyers have already been tabled , the reasons for an appeal and the courts for years to be dealing with . outline court applications in hayes - . 
<finished>: one of the reasons is the fact that it is reporting on the process , including through the extensive use of twitter by durchschnittsreporter - to a " zirkusatmosphäre ' and such a widespread , details , so that the jury in an improper manner by the public indignation influenced had been was promptly penetration , must come hard by the provozierendsten . 
<finished>: this could lead to deal with the question of whether the new technologies , new rules in the courtroom will be necessary , to employ , appelationsgerichte objection . 
<finished>: " during this process , i believe that there is indeed a danger is that , if the new technologies in the courtroom to each individual 's right to a fair trial , " said thomas j. ullman , - hayes influenced the arrival , i have seen it as i as . 
<finished>: the presiding judge , jon c . , last week , the applications by short - and - sweet , as he has said , that the new media ' carefully controlled ' , and that there is no proof that the jury of passions have been forced . there would be back ruling pointed out blue by the supreme kammergericht 
<finished>: but that was certainly does not yet have the last word on this matter . 
<finished>: for decades have gerichtseinsprüche , noted that the reporting on cases of doubt about the fairness of the process or infamous famous - pay . 
<finished>: in his decision , the supreme court of the united states the judgment against sam sheppard , osteopaths from cleveland , his wife killed and said in his decision , that there is because of the new media , a ' karnevalsatmosphäre in the courtroom , " would have been lifted , is supposed to have a dr . 1966 of historical . 
<finished>: some people believe that the kid and the ' on the run ' on this crime based about . 
<finished>: some lawyers say , gerichtseinsprüche hayes condemnation , half a century later , the argument that new rules are necessary , in order to ensure the channels of communication open from the courtroom , the time of the dr . sheppard still were unimaginable , if could . , which - to regulate . 
<finished>: " there is a good reason , on the impact of the new media in processes , the public to be alarmed , " said john j. donohue iii , a professor at the law school , of the existence of the death penalty in connecticut has investigated . his report , according to will it arbitrarily imposed stanford , to be followed by a broad . 
<finished>: professor donohue said , some appelationsgerichte could be that the restriction of communication from the courtroom out could be the processes of fair . promptly fascinated by the idea of 
<finished>: the twitter - matter is only one of many , the lawyers of hayes , in order to discuss and thus a condemnation of years on set - to delay them . 
<finished>: the defender claim , for example , also , that hayes already , as a judge not to allow them to have had , the reactions of potential juroren to test , by giving them during the jurorenauswahl appalling tatortfotos blue could be regarded with hostility under any circumstances have been - showed . 
<finished>: some of the photos of the victims , hawke - petit years , and their tüchter , hayley , seventeen years , and michaela , eleven years , you would have been met with disgust 48 : , that juroren said . 
<finished>: the defender say , they would also be the constitutionality of the death penalty , and argue that the judge mistakenly a jury of a critic of the public prosecutor 's office and that he put pressure on the ruling would have constituted , as he was in the unusual decision had been taken , the jury over the weekend free . way , would have been unacceptable , exchanged have put constitution in question 
<finished>: the juroren were not isolated . 
<finished>: but their arguments on the influence of the detailed reporting on the process drags is perhaps the greatest interest to itself . 
<finished>: in a urteilsanfechtung , last month , the fact that the case has been in the news in connecticut dominated during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the united states senate by the candidates , and had been discussed , they noted , have tabled it . 
<finished>: they argued that the new media constantly the flames of the emotions on the case reopened . 
<finished>: " such a crush of cameras and reporters outside the gerichtssaals ' , the lawyers , " in new haven and perhaps even across the country , has not yet seen . " still has previously stated that day - to - day medienpiepser 
<finished>: their focus on the reporting by twitter , is controversial . 
<finished>: in interviews , he said some of the journalists that the claim that this direct news were aufwieglerischer than reports , the slower , a glance of the reporting on future processes verarme , was technikfeindlicher be reimbursed . 
<finished>: but some lawyers said , would often with the argument that social and technical changes to the adaptation by the need to face appelationsgerichte courts . 
<finished>: lawyers step up this assertion . hayers - . 
<finished>: in her objection to the decision of the supreme court , in which the condemnation of dr . sheppard due to the reporting has been lifted and made it clear that the new media , new rules require 1966 , of itself , referred to it . 
<finished>: " this case , " wrote to you , " represents sheppard against maxwell of the twenty - first century . so , " 
<finished>: can courtesy of the divisive link ? 
<finished>: after a campaign in schimpfwörtern and negativity is this week , little courtesy in washington has broken out . 
<finished>: it is the omen , a real zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion , before returning to the fight of the parties in the capital quickly we return ? 
<finished>: the meeting on tuesday between president obama and the leaders of the congress expressed no breakthrough in the big questions , with the one during the ' lame duck ' , the meeting at the end of a period in which no decisions will be taken , has had to employ session pyramid . . 
<finished>: after all , it has not been a discussion between two different sides , nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern , but rather an empty episode of a partisan punktesammelns courtly listening to , what we are . 
<finished>: the public meetings of the defizitkommission of the president on wednesday , was also in a civilised , despite the political differences between the members continue to exist . 
<finished>: it seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months , a mutual respect , the ideological divide that continues to support the members divides them , the emergence of leaves . 
<finished>: this is hardly enough to claim that it is a new era of cooperation to make their voice heard . 
<finished>: both sides are now in a test phase - in of the one of the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise , while trying to define the limits of the public opinion and the patience of voters after a re - parteienkriegsführung weigh themselves to demand it . 
<finished>: therefore , were at the meeting on tuesday , himself , and his assessment by the participants on a minimum level of demands or accusations of limited . 
<finished>: the philosophical differences between obama and the republicans are too big and too deep , a rapid change in the atmosphere , which in the past two years , was , one might expect it as that . 
<finished>: regardless of whether it is a matter of taxes , donations , health or benefits , that is the two sides are walk for miles away from each other . 
<finished>: last but not least , the novemberwahl washington , at least for a short time mild . 
<finished>: " there is no question that the tone has changed , " said pete wehner , an official representative of the bush administration , the now for the " ethics and public policy center " is working . 
<finished>: " this is after elections inevitable . 
<finished>: elections give partisan passions , the once again feel . 
<finished>: and that is a good thing . " 
<finished>: in a number of issues , particularly in those that are on the agenda of the ' lame duck have both republicans and democrats , hardly any other choice than to find a solution , " are session . " 
<finished>: bush 's tax cuts end at the end of the year , and no - one is in favour of this . 
<finished>: both sides want to find a way to some , or even all , to receive , whether it is temporarily or permanently . 
<finished>: it is also a compromise with regard to the increase in unemployment benefit , as is to be expected , if only because the republicans , it is that the tax cuts for the rich , while they are unemployed workers to support a preferred believes that we will not be able to afford to deny . 
<finished>: after the meeting on tuesday at the white house is the optimism has risen , that these issues during the ' lame duck ' some and , at the same time , the new start treaty , cannot ratify session in one . 
<finished>: but william glaston of brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of lame duck ' does not necessarily to a lasting cooperation between the parties , if the new congress in january , to be convened . twelve must lead session . 
<finished>: instead , he says , is in a phase of the nichtübereinstimmens more likely , perhaps even inevitable . 
<finished>: " after the things that need to be done , and done , this will be short - term psychology in confrontation , " said erupt into him . 
<finished>: wehner is also sceptical of this - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy to real cooperation . 
<finished>: " i see a lot of what is happening , as , or shadow - boxing show , for the main event of 2012 ' , he said with until today to 2012 . 
<finished>: the reasons for this have a great deal of work with the new republican majority in the white house to do so , and with the teeparty - voters , the presentation of their education , are conducive to goods . 
<finished>: how concerned the republican leaders may be , that they are too high , you know that you have to try to live up to their promises , the expenditure of the government and to reduce the health reform to be repealed , vie to comply with this , too . 
<finished>: this parteilinien are already in the first reactions as regards the recommendations of a tax reform and some taxes , as well as the increase in the retirement age and cut government spending , raise the , which clearly defizitkommission include . 
<finished>: the deputy chairman alan simpson and bowles have one of the most difficult jobs in washington and have , in accordance with their own assessment , so much so that the defizitfrage on the public agenda , that that they will no longer be ignored , can be pushed to erskine . 
<finished>: but they need within the commission fourteen of the eighteen votes in order to ensure that its plan for the official recommendation to make , and they are fighting very , in order to also only in the vicinity of these numbers to come . 
<finished>: the biggest opposition , the elected representatives of the people of the body , as in finance , at least today , little room for manoeuvre , or little sympathy for compromises is in place is . 
<finished>: galston says two stages in the fight between the white house and the republicans in congress . 
<finished>: the first fight will be next year , in the form of parteizusammenstößen take place , if the republicans , obama in terms of the budget , taxes and the health system to challenge , later followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation . 
<finished>: what will this change ? 
<finished>: the public opinion . 
<finished>: it is a proven fact that , in spite of the partisanship of the current election , the majority of americans are still hopes that the two parties to work together . 
<finished>: if confrontation in a blind alley , as it happened , then both parties must have a careful look at the public reaction 1995 respect . 
<finished>: whoever is on the losing will change tack and the compromise must seek , will be sentenced . 
<finished>: this may , in fact , an optimistic view . 
<finished>: partisanship and polarization are greater now than it was in the middle , and they seem to have a greater ideological gap between obama and the congress - republicans to be between president bill clinton and the republicans at the time as years of 1990s . 
<finished>: at the same time , to see the activists from both parties 2010 as a prelude to a much broader election result in pure 2012 . 
<finished>: so it may be a matter of courtesy , this week will be borne by many americans , to be welcomed . 
<finished>: but it will be on both sides very much more effort to require a common denominator in the questions to find the two still separate . 
<finished>: durchgesickertes us - document procreate moscow as a port of corruption 
<finished>: the control of the city lies in the hands of the ' kleptocracy " and they are a part of the bribes and the little darlings , the kremlin further in february , the american embassy in russia in a memo reported . so in you , the schutzgeldes . 
<finished>: both the police and the state security service , so that they have their expensive standard of living in moscow , so it is able to keep receive payments blackmail high . 
<finished>: they collect money not only of legitimate shops , but also of organised criminal gangs . 
<finished>: every stratum of bureaucracy and red tape - which prime minister vladimir putin as a " vertical of authority " - takes its part of the money that the head after the top has described . 
<finished>: the memo , which , under the name of the ambassador john beyrle after washington was broadcast , was on tuesday on its web site , published by wikileaks . 
<finished>: the memo is based on sources , whose names have been edited . 
<finished>: it was written , while yuri luzhkov still moscow mayor was , and it accused him of corruption . 
<finished>: he has been in october by president dmitry medvedev kicked out , but there is little evidence that , in the meantime , it would have been cleared up . 
<finished>: luzhkov and his wife , yelena baturina , a well - known construction company , have over the years , and he has many verleumdungsklagen against such accusations , rejected accusations of corruption are constantly has won . 
<finished>: in september , he said a russian television station , as he was asked about it , he was corrupt : " it is crazy , it is bad way , it is cloudy , the suggested documentation after a . " 
<finished>: > , an incredibly large number of russians believe that their society is corrupt . this have surveys show . 
<finished>: but it is unusual , that , as in the report of the ambassador to happen , individual persons , and it is that this is a diplomat of a foreign country is happening in vain . 
<finished>: " the direct link to the government of moscow with the crime has meant , however , that some of them as " disrupted and come to the conclusion that the government is as a government " , such as the memo kleptokrat rather as a call " . 
<finished>: " criminal elements " kryshna ' ( a term from the world of the criminal / the mafia , word - for - word ' bush ' or protection means ) , the police , the ( fsb ) , the dienstaufsichtsbehörde ( mvd ) and the office of the public prosecutor , as well as by the whole of moscow regierungsbürokratie extends state security on the what a enjoy . 
<finished>: experts have a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of moscow will be discovered . 
<finished>: " luzhkov is at the top . " 
<finished>: " the fsb , mvd and the militia are on the second stage ' . 
<finished>: " the least impact the ordinären criminal and the criminal inspectors at the lowest level . " 
<finished>: " this is a inkompetentes system , in the criminal groups in some areas close a gap , because the city had no offers help . " 
<finished>: the report says that the fsb money from the largest firms and the police , small business people arrested cashed in . 
<finished>: a source , is that moscow to understand that it is best to the protection of the fsb ( and not by organised crime ) , not only because they are more weapons , resources and power than the criminals , but also because they are protected by law , will get to mvd and shopkeepers ' said it means . ' 
<finished>: " it is for this reason that the protection by criminal gangs are no longer so asked how it used to be . " 
<finished>: the memo pointed out that , while the collection of money is comprehensive , the protection itself is very modest no ; even the , the figures are sometimes arrested . 
<finished>: the figures , which do not find their business very quickly closed above - on the grounds of one or other vorwands . 
<finished>: medvedev has , on several occasions , talked about it , to combat corruption , but at the same time he said that he only little progress has been made . 
<finished>: the memo , the message contains descriptions of men with with packed , which is presumably entirely with money , in the kremlin . 
<finished>: " in his fight against corruption must bureaucrats to leave , " said georgy satarov , director of a moscow think - tank , in a recent interview , by the medvedev on . 
<finished>: " but he is part of this red tape . " 
<finished>: " it is not a part of the political class , because a political class in russia no longer exists . " 
<finished>: without a politician , without an opposition , without a separation of powers , so he says , corruption is inevitable . 
<finished>: across the country , is costing the corruption russia more than $ 300 billion per year by , so estimates . 
<finished>: the country 154 global perception of corruption by the non - governmental organisation transparence internationally ( of " the least corrupt ' to ' most corrupt ' ) will be countries to a newer study on top . 
<finished>: the revelation of the memos , the american embassy in moscow time , within the russian government , even though , as luzhkov for the mistakes of moscow may be accused of , it is for the kremlin , too , could be a way to claim that the problems trigger displeasure with security will be done at night , according to solve . 
<finished>: in an interview with larry king for cnn claimed that the wikileaks documents and reacted furiously to the revelation that american diplomats him batman and medvedev robin have mentioned could be a forgery , putin . 
<finished>: " the truth is , that it is a question of our interaction is , which is an important factor in the internal politics in this country , " he said . 
<finished>: " but to be honest , we would not have expected that , with a kind of arrogance to happen , with a kind of pressure and in such a way , you know unethical . " 
<finished>: rouge rouge veterans on the confrontation with the past forced 
<finished>: in a weak betonierten schoolroom before with dirty and abblätternden walls , director of the anlong veng high school in the man who built the later rouge rouge leader ta mok in him , has the reminds us , under consideration . 
<finished>: " everyone here loves ta mok . " 
<finished>: " he was a good leader , and he has been taken care of , " said sreng kor ma , 42 people in order to his years . 
<finished>: because of its brutality during the khmer rouge rule known as ' the schlachter ' in this remote former khmer rouge stronghold in the north - west , where he bridges are being built , the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live and popular cambodia 's commander , remains the hospitals . 
<finished>: but this year , twelve years after the surrender of the khmer rouge in relation to the government , will be long - standing supporters in anlong veng challenged . 
<finished>: in april , a local truth and versöhnungsforum the victims of the public confrontation with the people , which was once the regime allowed have supported . 
<finished>: in june the government a schulbuch , the children of former soldiers of the history of the khmer rouge told time on the first circulated . 
<finished>: and in july , the united nations and cambodia for the first time , a former member of the khmer rouge , as it is the former head of the notorious tuol sleng torture chamber , kaing khek iev , better known as thirty - five years in prison , to be penalised by gemeinschaftstribunal convicted a convicted . 
<finished>: with each of these developments under the khmer rouge veterans alnlong vengs , their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration in society , in the difficult fear grew the cambodia . 
<finished>: " on the other hand , rejection and fear in the former khmer rouge , but they have no power to do anything to do , " said chhang youk , head of the centralised documentation instrument recording of cambodia , an independent organisation , which the regime always there has yet to be explored . 
<finished>: " for you to live under the khmer rouge glorious , but the regime is a symbol of the evil ' has become the was . 
<finished>: " it is dividing itself families . " 
<finished>: during the khmer rouge rule in cambodia , and an estimated seven million people executed or died of disease , revision or before they were using , in between hunger .

<finished>: pol pot , nuon chea and ieng sary , the guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of cambodia , ta mok , the next generation in anlong withdrew as veng beaters . 
<finished>: but , as a result of the un peace agreement , the first democratic elections , the country 's large groups of khmer rouge fighters , to the government , which is what causes the kapitulationen of ieng sary and khieu samphan 1998 nuan chea , and cross rouge began led to providing 1993 years in the mid - 1990s led . 
<finished>: pol pot died a natural death , and ta mok , do not give in to had been in the dangrek 1999 by government forces 1998 mountain has been arrested . 
<finished>: he died in 2006 in the prison of phnom penh , where he is on his process waiting . 
<finished>: they are no longer protected , the majority of former khmer rouge fighters in bring relief from grinding poverty of rural cambodia and many of the movement in nostalgischer had gönner as their memory . 
<finished>: even if some of the few elite official of the khmer rouge , their local regierungsposten kept , because they have handed in their weapons , the simple soldiers of the poor , ignorant farmers remained as to place . 
<finished>: " these people have only very little of the benefits , " said sok leang by the centre for justice and reconciliation , in the whole of cambodia , also in anlong veng , public forums does capitulation 
<finished>: " they are anchored in the utopian agrarideologie of the regime . " 
<finished>: " they grew up without any berufswissen on . " 
<finished>: sor lim , who as a teenager of rhmer rouge had joined , fought in the jungle to anlang veng , before he is 1998 niederließ , in order to live a life as a poor reisbauer 1974 55 years of lead . 
<finished>: ' life under the khmer rouge was a good thing , " he said . 
<finished>: " ta mok each has something to eat . ' 
<finished>: " but now life is difficult , because we have to look to ourselves . " 
<finished>: the khmer rouge tribunal has also raises concerns out . 
<finished>: at the beginning of next year , will be trying nuon chea , khieu samphan , ieng sary , and his wife , as well as mr ieng thirith , another former khmer rouge minister , before , the court of justice . 
<finished>: the mandate given to the court , it is , the old leaders and those who are responsible , to condemn them , but it is not said , is whether it is on these four cases further action will follow atrocities , mainly for the . 
<finished>: this has done little to the fears in anlong veng to alleviate . 
<finished>: current media speculation in years , during the khmer rouge rule in the late 1970s distriktchefin in the province of manteay meanchey , focused , performed chaem have to have been . 
<finished>: they are representative of the centralised documentation instrument recording of cambodia , you have the construction of the dam , a project , in which thousands of forced labour , presumably , guided trapeang thma told had 2007 died .

<finished>: " cambodia must be a hole in the gulf and the past has been buried , " he said . 
<finished>: but the confrontation with the past is what cambodia must do in order to move forward , said chhang youk by documentation . 
<finished>: " reconciliation with the khmer rouge - times means to gather the broken pieces , ' he said . 
<finished>: " it is our duty , this broken parts together , so that the way in which everything can understand . " 
<finished>: the centre of the government on khmer rouge , the 75seitige ' history of the democratic cambodia schulbuch approved the first created " . 
<finished>: the book in june in anlong veng for the high school of the ministry of education , which is less than four pages on the khmer rouge rouge history as an annex to the spread , it contains .

<finished>: " my family rejects many parts of the book , and the court from ' , he said . 
<finished>: " they are suspicious , because they are not sure how many people from the court to be sentenced . " 
<finished>: such a resistance that makes the process of reconciliation is complex and complicated , said sok leang . 
<finished>: but the public forums , the schulbuch and the court is to gain influence , " and he said . 
<finished>: still has the rouge rouge , here , a powerful attraction .

<finished>: in a joint statement after a meeting of the secretary of state hillary clinton with the belorussian minister for foreign affairs , sergei martynov in an additional article of the sicherheitsgipfels rodham was the deal was announced .

<finished>: the agreement seems to be one of the most important results of obama 's " nuclear summit on security of 47 nations ' from april , to be excluded from the belarus has had . 
<finished>: and it was obvious to the invitation of the former soviet republic at the next summit , good enough to secure . 
<finished>: " i was really excited by the fact that they have a seat in the nuclear summit on security ( of 2012 ) want to . " 
<finished>: " this proves to me that it works , " said ken luongo , president of the partnership for global security , a group on the promotion of nuclear safety . 
<finished>: clinton called the agreement " a very significant , important step " of belarus . 
<finished>: obama promised in april in prague , within a period of four years , everything precarious nuclear material is to be ensured . 
<finished>: since then , the united states government has six countries that helped her high - enriched uranium los . 
<finished>: belarus will be the seventh . 
<finished>: a dozen or so countries did it under the administration of george w. bush . 
<finished>: obama 's nuclear summit on security of belarus has president alexander lukashenko , declared that the nation will never give up its uranium to be of the time . 
<finished>: " as to retain high - enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos , what fundamentally waffenfähig is , and less - enriched uranium , " said lukashenko at that time . 
<finished>: " this is our raw material . we will not derive any dirty bombs and we will sell it to anyone " . . . 
<finished>: " we use it solely for research purposes , that is all . "

<finished>: the second attempt was decided on monday and was , according to the official by plane carried out . 
<finished>: the us government is paying for this $ million , while a large part of the money in the belarusian research with weak enriched uranium for nuclear weapons cannot be used , not flowing , which fourteen effort . 
<finished>: " this was a coordinated , in order to build confidence , " the agreement , which was signed by president clinton , said andrew bieniawski , a representative of the council , this is due to the global develop works makes , which led to the vote and extremely careful . 
<finished>: the james martin centre for studies that belarus in this year at least eighty pounds waffenfähhigen uranium had , as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium , nichtweiterzugebende estimates . 
<finished>: belarus will , according to the common agreement be camp 2012 away . 
<finished>: the relationship between belarus and the united states have been tense for years , first and foremost because of lukashenko 's harsh suppression of human rights . 
<finished>: but the statement from wednesday suggests a possible rapprochement . 
<finished>: " the global security issues , welcome to the united states of america and belarus , that respect for democracy and human rights in belarus is a key issue in the improvement of the bilateral relations , and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens , " said they increased known give heißend , this is a step forward .

<finished>: it is a fundamental new perspective on the design of our future , with the maintenance of the old traditions of many of its partners of germany clashed . 
<finished>: in the light of the resistance in europe beginning in germany on three possible ways out of the crisis to spekuliern . 
<finished>: the first : a strong euro with germany , austria , the netherlands and other countries , while the south have to leave the euro . 
<finished>: the second : the reintroduction of the german mark - despite the fact that at the moment , rather , for science fiction , is supported by a large proportion of public opinion , around fifty per cent of the population - sounds . 
<finished>: the third : a transformation of the euro , according to german proposals . this means : more macro - economic supervision ; strict financial management ; to penalising the countries ; the zahlungseinstellung of some countries , as well as the extension of the costs of adaptation to the private sector potential möglichereweise the requirements are invading . 
<finished>: the german position is clear , and for some time . that is why there is now no excuses already is . 
<finished>: first of all , as both the imf as well as the european commission , the incentives for the deficits and the german government are a constitutional reform from the sleeves , in order to make this 2016 to prevent the vessel , 2009 . 
<finished>: it was the first between germany ( tax plans and stable public finances ) and the practices of its european partners , including france . strict thought necessary , what the signs for the drifting apart 
<finished>: the second sign is a central european country , as mrs merkel , the decision to bail out greece , painful hinausschob the set . 
<finished>: at that time , it was the much criticised , but the fact of the matter is that the political consensus in germany , the public and the published opinion is totally opposed to a bail - out of greece . 
<finished>: merkel , in the last of a clear position it calls for a reform of the agreements concluded by the european union , in order to ensure the survival of a country , to enable and , at the same time , the private lender , to commit themselves to a part of the costs . with oktobertagen new is finally out . 
<finished>: this position has been interpreted as anti - european , since they are the irlandkrise and everything the following advancing . 
<finished>: but if there is also something that has been adopted . in the course of the next few months we will be involved in the reform of the european union , these measures from 2013 sweetened proposal , which is intended to enable her to participate . 
<finished>: germany has a red line , which it does not have to exceed does . 
<finished>: it says all that - even if we now unpopular measures must be taken , it is as of that date , the old way of the euro , will no longer be available . 
<finished>: this will be a new currency zone , in which the countries will be forced to explain and , in this case , the private sector is a part of the costs . go bankrupt , is able to be punished , hard - geburtsjahr 2013 
<finished>: germany shows us that we need to take , with high levels of austerity and investitionsraten , moderation of the productivity and competitiveness , as well as positive the consumption , improving growth path in a tough external economic balances . 
<finished>: the other alternative , the debt and the construction industry with huge holes in the balance of payments is based , as they at times of boom in order simply will not be tolerated , was cited by spain on . 
<finished>: the offer is clear . 
<finished>: and we would be wrong to do that , it is not easy to understand . 
<finished>: it is not just a question of the government deficit by the end of year 2013 on three per cent runterzufahren . 
<finished>: the demands are much harder . 
<finished>: and the worst thing that we could do , under these conditions is ourselves to cheat . 
<finished>: i hope that the current turbulence in more calm . 
<finished>: and that we will have the opportunities , the us will be offered , until the spring 2013 will use . 
<finished>: it seems that mr zapatero has taken this so well , and his announcement ( of the promised reforms after the meeting i had with the large companies and the announcement of the new measures of yesterday ) that , in spite of the criticism of merkel 's hypothesis , his own house in order in to create , is their way of preparing , points out saturday at the last double has . 
<finished>: but the german red line is there , and it does not seem to me that something would change in the somme . 
<finished>: among the possibilities is the fact that we are the countries with little serious gestopften euro area fully to leave , should not be ruled out . what is considered 
<finished>: in this case , could germany would still have to say , it was warned us . 
<finished>: sport and regelumgehung 
<finished>: tricks , such as those of alonso and ramos in the game against the ajax show inventiveness , but not the will , a sanction to circumvent . 
<finished>: of the two players of real madrid ( xabi alonso and sergio ramos ) exclusion in november against the ajax in the champions league , that a lot of ink has been spilled , whether it is or not , and whether , perhaps , both players of the uefa sanction should be acted on a unsportliche act in order to discuss this led 23 stake by the evidenced by supposedly the . 
<finished>: as is well known , the two players , a couple of minutes before the team had won ) , time and several fouls , now that would ensure that the referee you the second yellow card showed played clearly ( her post - match has already been lost . 
<finished>: in this way , and as the real madrid his dignity , will be the two players the mandatory penalty at the next ligaspiel against the auxerre without so much as a set of cards in the next spielphase and meet cite group on the aeroplane . 
<finished>: finally , the disziplinarkommitee of the uefa , the coach of the club , josé mourinho , with two to play and the parties involved players with different sums of penalising . 
<finished>: the provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice , it is more often in the world of football . 
<finished>: it is so widespread that they form part of the ethos of the unwritten , but in this game , which is rules - is . 
<finished>: part of the debate about the case is that a team of football clubs real madrid ( which , in its national anthem and honour and on other occasions , his players for similar incidents punished had played , and at the dramatisierung by mourinho , the more to its long history , as theatralischer and provocative technicians has added to an episode which was a key player in the purports to be blocked , described going back that have arisen . 
<finished>: in any case , the debate about whether this does not refer specifically to the statutes of the principles of the sport , that is to say , whether these actions a regelumgehung actually believes this approach to the statutes of the sport , but it does not seem to make sense to circumvent . represent goes against type of prohibited is revolves . 
<finished>: in this matter , should the sporting spirit caused damage to be investigated . 
<finished>: the sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent , one aspect of the matter , which , by means of these actions is not threatened , because it was not to be an aggressive game . 
<finished>: a further aspect of a clean game is to avoid that , the players an unjustified benefits from the gegenteam . this , too , was not - . 
<finished>: the paradox of the action of the players of the real madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally under falschspiel or regelumgehung understand , because the rule was not secretly , in order to be a sanction to be avoided , but it should be so striking as possible , so that they will be punished by the referee made the purposes of circumvention . 
<finished>: the players waited and took the sanction joyfully . 
<finished>: another question is what kind of advantage the - from the deliberate fouls went . 
<finished>: here , it should be emphasised that the rival either in a less favourable situation brought benefits for the game because the obvious result of this action was that the own team with less players discussing without anybody , erheischt were played was still had to . 
<finished>: it is also not a useful strategy for the next game , because the club has not then on this players . 
<finished>: the benefit is that the players the next spielphase the champions league without maps , their participation in a future game could threaten , obviously , to start . 
<finished>: but it is a long - term that , to a certain extent , uncertain , given that the team could . in this way , a sanction and go in the second kartenzyklus on , in which they kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle because players also receive the retirement at some point also benefit retirement . 
<finished>: so it is not so clear , whether it is really an advantage . 
<finished>: ultimately , such practices are not opposed to the sporting spirit , which is also strategic decisions are , in order , from the rules to derive maximum benefit is directed . 
<finished>: in this case , wanted to keep the players do not sanction deal ( that would be , in fact , a clear case of regelumgehung ) , they wanted more choice , and when you look at this . 
<finished>: they met a strategic decision , without a penalty saved , or before her to flee . 
<finished>: although the border between intuition and regelumgebung is , i believe , that it is in this matter in order to have a clear case of intuition is blurred . 
<finished>: i have the impression that the controversy as a result of two factors : because it has to do with two selbstausschlüsse was , and because of the nature of the ordinary public whom regelübertragung is created . 
<finished>: the damage to the principles of the sport by these acts is less ethical rather than aesthetic , that has been inflicted on nature . 
<finished>: angebotoffensive to kundenfang for groups - weihnachtsabendessen in barcelona 
<finished>: the dictatorship of the calendar can be this year an avalanche of reservations on the days and december . 
<finished>: the thousands of employees , even paid to celebrate , they do not want more than twenty up to thirty euro . it is spreading from spending .

<finished>: the group is also of the eighteen . a überaktiver day with freundesgruppen , the christmas vorfeiern , will be that highlight , sources say . 
<finished>: of the six weihnachtsmenü for , or more than one has the impression that the customers are prepared to ten per cent more than in the previous year to spend and , in return , more details , such as , for example , cava . to wish . preishit added eur thirty gruppenmenüs was a 
<finished>: even in some of the companies we see green bean sprouts , which is why the employees will be invited . this gives the impression that the gruppenessen again in the recovery , they are . 
<finished>: fecasarm ( with mergers , restaurant - and freizeitverband of barcelona ) , the vice - chairman , enric gomà , the end of the tunnel , and noted that the " lively " , even though the customers ' a maximum pennies ' right reservations as a whole to familiar - such as the umbrella , on the part of the pubs . 
<finished>: the fun of the celebration was not , however , has fallen , regardless of who pays .

<finished>: islamabad is nuclear weapons ' faster than any other country . " 
<finished>: revelations by wikileaks confirm relations between the taliban and pakistan . 
<finished>: the website wikileaks revealed the content of the correspondence between the north american embassy in pakistan and the united states - staatsabteilung confirmed , the pakistani nuclear programme to washington to ensure the enormous of the worries . 
<finished>: on the fringes of the details of the documents on the content of the talks and the way of thinking of the north american diplomats in islamabad , to offer that the cooperation between the two countries in terms of nuclear safety is not strengthened , but , on the contrary , " falling " , and that the unstable asian country more nuclear weapons ' a swifter rhytmus than any other country " , reveal these accredited to the informative and saftigen , which produces . 
<finished>: in particular , the nature of the pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not , but their constituent parts will be stored in a possible attack their destruction to make it more difficult to put washington sleepless nights - in order to , are composed . 
<finished>: ambassador anne w. patterson , in a report ahead of the visit of the former head of the national security council , james jones , said : " the close proximity to some of the taliban , they were scattered in the nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material , " will presumably adopt the beleaguered field of nuclear power plants for the , in pakistan risks include the following . 
<finished>: the great number of people , in the nuclear arsenals and the ballistic missile programmes not only by the united states , but also of russia as ausufernd and reason to proceed with caution , more implied , will be seen . 
<finished>: " pakistan gläubiges staff of the nuclear power plants due to the low educational and cultural level have extremist organisations are more opportunities for people , or to the expert yuri korolev by the russian foreign ministry , in a meeting with his american counterpart , . said , " rocket programmes which represent the lack of nuclear power - play , reklutieren ; stop guards have strictly

<finished>: on the hunt for wikileaks boss 
<finished>: obama appoints a high level of those responsible for the antiterrorismuskampf on the prevention of new revelations . 
<finished>: interpol is a red warning to persecution and capable of assange . 
<finished>: everything , wikileaks and its founder , jullian assange , a complicated maze , in which the facts just difficult to enlighten is connected with what i have . 
<finished>: interpol ' red warning ' to ' location and persecution ' of assange from was yesterday . 
<finished>: it is , however , not a traditional order to arrest . 
<finished>: in addition , it is not new , it comes from the twenty november . 
<finished>: it has nothing to do with the revelation of more than four million diplomatic documents from the united states to do so , but with the accusations of sexual abuse , to which the australians in sweden last , too , must face up to . 
<finished>: furthermore , the lawyer of the founder of wikileaks , mark stephens , " the police , where and how they contact with mr assange could " take would be assured . 
<finished>: already , there were the international police force , with its headquarters in lyon ( france ) , at the request of sweden , the order from , but it was until yesterday by the swedish authorities have not announced the power after receiving the . on twenty . 
<finished>: so are the things . the 188 interpol - countries are dependent on assange to identify and locate , " in order to provisionally arrest him and extradite . " 
<finished>: although interpol of a red warning affected , many member states of the organisation of the red warning as a carte blanche for a arrestierung the national police force must be carried out , in particular , if they have a bilateral extradition treaty , as is the case of sweden and england , where assange is likely to have - of - the statements according to look at individual cannot issue orders of the arrest . 
<finished>: assange 's lawyers , the gestures of a letter in which they were informed that the thirty - nine - year - old founder of wikileaks is prepared by video conference , the questions of the swedish authorities to answer about published , causing the action . 
<finished>: they also recall that assange to sweden by the prosecutor , who , with the sagenumwobenen lavrentiy pavlovich beria , head of security of stalin , compared to the relevant authorisation and the departure from skin cancer that has received . 
<finished>: " this is like a hunting , not as a legal persecution ' , will be in the letter . 
<finished>: while the world is looking for him - and his mother of australia from the innocence of their son assange is in an unknown location in ; not , however , believes that claimed - silent . 
<finished>: on monday , he was the head of the magazine by skype from an interview he questioned the resignation of the secretary of state of the united states , hillary clinton conversation . from a vague on the ground in the time . 
<finished>: " if it can be proved that they have been responsible for the north american diplomats , the un and , hence , against the united states signed international agreements , it should resign " , he said , has violated the spy orders . 
<finished>: his opinion was of the white house , robert gibbs , the request for the resignation as a " ridiculous and absurd " of the condemned , pressesekretär yesterday by the described . 
<finished>: " i am not sure why we value , to the opinion of a type with a website , " he told the cnn should lay . 
<finished>: obama himself has a high , rusell travers , with the prevention of new dokumentenenthüllungen antiterrorismuskampf responsible for the task . 
<finished>: the attempt by the spokesman of the präsidenden barack obama , assange to pay less attention to , stands in stark contrast to the conservative politicians and commentators these days , in the opinions , to announce . 
<finished>: congressman peter king , the from january , the chair of the national sicherheitskommitee the chamber of deputies will lead the staatsabteilung asked to examine the possibility of wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations , " in order to spend their money on , and everyone supports you , or to make a contribution to seize has , to follow . " 
<finished>: tom flanagan , an adviser to the canadian president stephen harper , was to have gone still further , and he had to his statement , assange had " murdered " betrayed . 
<finished>: " president obama ought to him in a target and a not manned aircraft or so what use turn . " 
<finished>: apologetic , was mike huckabee , minister , a former governor of arkansas and possible baptistischer not who is presidential candidate . 
<finished>: " anyone who was in the government information he is guilty of treason and no execution eiine to mild punishment ' , he told the station , fox is , everything is , leaked was always there , too . 
<finished>: puigcercós addiction with a nod to the carod close to peace in the erc 
<finished>: the republican leaders allowed the party to a secret vote on his persistence in the office . 
<finished>: huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the vollversammlungsprinzips before . 
<finished>: joan puigcercós seems like a recipe for the umpteenth time a internal turmoil in the ranks of the following the loss of members of parliament and the half of the votes richtungslosen erc from , to have found the way to go . 
<finished>: aware that his threat of resignation to the close of the former parteiführers , josep lluís carod - rovira is not enough , but he also knows that the influence of this sector today so as their mentor , himself , and he did not have the same headaches , as other former will spread is weakened is the chairman is currents . 
<finished>: the leaders of esquerra with a nod to the new critics to win , what its position until the next elections would secure tried to reason . 
<finished>: for the early kündete yesterday that the over two hundred regional members of the council to be remain in office for a secret could answer on erc is . 
<finished>: with ballot papers , not with gehobener hand . 
<finished>: if the carodisten the präsidenen a parking ticket , you could do this , without needing to fear repression wanted to miss . 
<finished>: in fact , the head of both the impression of division , as well as the submission to the person that would like to avoid . 
<finished>: in several interviews confirmed he , with half of the vote were not confirmed , and he added without any indication of a result " in the bulgarian - style " would not be good either , prozentwerten added feel , plus one is he would . 
<finished>: the carod close call from the president more than just the party of his office to a lack of gesture , as puigcercós the supreme body of congresses . to provide controls . 
<finished>: but since they do not have a sufficient majority to enhance of resignations , they will be with the board of a policy plan from now until may . 
<finished>: for this is what they expect , in the process of drafting the document on strategic change of direction , that the leadership of the council will be put to the vote , will be able to take part in the eighteenth . . 
<finished>: their intention is for puigcercós . in return , this promise , the congress in the autumn , which is already a fact for leader 2011 offices to it , does . 
<finished>: the leader of the erc is of the view that ' ' it is a pity the stability and , once and for all , the organisation in the situation , to bring their dirty linen behind closed doors to seeks he polyphonie wash . 
<finished>: in this sense , the article , which the president - in - office conseller josep huguet in his blog , is symptomatic of the sign . 
<finished>: in the light of the puigcercós more than an ideologue is the owner of innovació it for a fact that the party leaders ' in exchange for various objectives ' will be felt , . 
<finished>: he was one of five , of which two in the foreground . 
<finished>: firstly , the ' restructuring ' of the board of directors , so that this is at least ninety per cent of party members , that is to say , the inclusion of new faces from carods represents environment . 
<finished>: the second could be the big news . 
<finished>: huguet proposes , erc vollversammlungsprinzip as a functioning at long last the should give up . 
<finished>: so verfechtet he a reform of the statutes , which should make it possible for the congresses with elected delegates to hold . 
<finished>: by the end of the vollversammlungsmodells - an exception in spanish - is puigcercós ' team , which has been on the last two conferences fought as obsessed with party system . 
<finished>: in fact , it was on to the assembly of the review of the vollversammlungsprinzips on a congress , which has to do with the reform of the statutes should deal with the party leadership 2008 bebenden instructed . 
<finished>: this deadline is yet to come , as the internal infogle aufruhe of the last few years to address that this matter is not advisable . 
<finished>: now , without the critical sectors are waiting in the wings , could the time has come to be , in order to bring this matter up again and take for ever to complete .

<finished>: " san shou ' or ' sanda ' are from china , where faustschläge and fußtritte as well as bodenwürfe disciplines originating are admissible . 
<finished>: the play is normally on a platform , rare zweikämpfe in a boxing ring . 
<finished>: the renommierteste boxkämpfer , from this kind of kampfsportes is the americans vietnamese origin cung le , who in the world of kampfkünste is well known , has emerged .

<finished>: fifty million in contracts without invitation to tender 
<finished>: hydro - quebec has , in mutual agreement projektplanungsfirmen fifty million dollars of contracts for the hydro eastmain - one - a - sarcelle - rupert . 
<finished>: in the middle of this avalanche of more than a hundred treaties , is a consortium of firms bpr , dessau , groupe sm and axor , of which the most important part , namely the projektleitung , to a sum of millions of dollars without invitation to tender has received same the , consisting of . 
<finished>: this consortium , dubbed " énergie gérance 2004 as a result of the decision by hydro - quebec , the private sector , this important project , amounting to a sum of five billion dollars to future generations , hydroelectric , your sense of responsibility was " , has been set up . 
<finished>: at the beginning of 2005 ergatterte énergie gérance ' the lucrative contract , without , however , that there is a public invitation to tender , there had been " the consortium . 
<finished>: for the parti québécois is resorting to unternehmenskonsortien a serious ethical problem , which means that the risk of wettbewerbsverdrändung , as well as a price hike in the making . 
<finished>: " this is a new way to a conspiracy and refutes the competition . " 
<finished>: " this means that abgekartete games rather than on the way now , " said yesterday sylvain simard , a member of the pq , at the press conference to carry out , in an open form of secret instead of one . 
<finished>: early in the morning had the question before the national assembly raised , because it seems to him , such as the interest of the general public and in this way can be understandable difficult simard . 
<finished>: ressourcenministerin nathalie normandeau had responded to it , vehemently denies that it is in this treaty is a stitch - up game action would have been asked by the afternoon it . 
<finished>: " i am sticking to my faithful to ' , they are , by you , the pq was " dishonest " and " lack of toughness , " reiterated wetterte . 
<finished>: she said , " it was the very least ' , that the pq is apologize . 
<finished>: the model of the consortium is the world 's standard practice . 
<finished>: it is usually in order to a temporary alliance , which is the result of two or more companies to allow them to carry out their expertise in terms of an invitation to tender for a complex project to pool resources to restrictions that would so . 
<finished>: the project ' eastmain ' has a high komplexitätsniveau with regard to his arbeitsausmaßes on . 
<finished>: the bauverfahren is well under way , and is to be drawn up by 2012 . 
<finished>: however , the treaty has been awarded without competition can take place ; it has already had the negotiations had that a given . 
<finished>: furthermore , the model of the consortium in quebec , even in relatively simple projects , by no means more an exception . 
<finished>: as the newspaper ' le devoir ' last week has pointed out , is that in the area of a civil engineer - and beratungswesens applied model of the consortium of the subject of regierungsermittlungen . 
<finished>: a brief glance of the quebecer unternehmensregisters allows it , over two hundred consortia , to appoint some of which of a steady period appear to be . 
<finished>: in this way , and , for example , the company dessau , in partnership with the majority of their kernkonkurrenten cima + , génivar , snc - lavalin or roche and tecsult count , which , to working way together . 
<finished>: any link , and of which there are several dozen , leads to one and the same legal person back , namely to dessau . 
<finished>: what the consortium of ' énergie gérance ' minister stressed that " the territory of the baie james a special arbeitskräftedynamik hydro - quebec this since the seventies , in particular the type and manner " . bill pays homage to the fact that is subject to and normandeau is concerned , it was 
<finished>: réal laporte , the société énergie de la baie james ( sebj ) , has issued a statement , which the nose on the fact that the treaty on the projektleitung after agreement has been granted leave has no ' d major employers . 
<finished>: " if you 're a tender power and that it was only a few candidates , will be your prices in the fees . " 
<finished>: " you 're so two possibilities : either you nimmst the people who are in this laar : there will be a satisfactory agreement , at a good price you are and say to negotiate . " 
<finished>: " the idea is , however , that is not the price is crucial , but the expertise of the people " , confirmed laporte . 
<finished>: the consortium " énergie gérance ' treaty is part of a long list of more than fifty thousand of the parti québécois received , contracts that have been approved this dollar . 
<finished>: the treaties have been either of the hydro - quebec , or the sebj for the project eastmain - one - a - sarcelle - rupert has been approved . 
<finished>: after reviewing the newspaper ' le devoir ' more than a hundred engineer - and beraterverträge , the firms or their subsidiaries , including , in particular , ressourcenlabors , between last year and march was granted . 
<finished>: snc - lavalin 22 treaties gerafft , had received , tecsult dessau , without their participation in " énergie gérance ' counting . this ten and sixteen génivar itself had 
<finished>: all these contracts are negotiated . 
<finished>: it is estimated the total at 449 783 344 $ , the treaty with " énergie gérance ' on same 131 564 $ included in it . 
<finished>: sylvain simard had that the four firms , the ( bpr , dessau , groupe sm and axor ) the ' parti libéral du quebec , well - known " form the consortium , said . 
<finished>: minister normandeau had let it be known that the associated with the firms that they " - funded ' , before they specify that they are , rather , whose senior executives were equally pq was . 
<finished>: barometers verantworungsbewußten consumption - the ' green ' label is not inspire me with confidence 
<finished>: green , but frankly sceptical . 
<finished>: the consumer has little to become the protagonists in terms of sustainable growth , but the unmarked brands or the eco - labelling , which is his choice of taxes to as little trust quebecer should . 
<finished>: it is a pity that , although it is in a universe they are swimming , information for the benefit of a consumption only so : the barometer has led to a lack of credible information to mourn , a deficiency , which as a brake power , as the first reading showed yesterday was held clear his commitment to consumption crawling aim of where it responsible media . 
<finished>: even though they are the consumption of so - called socially responsible products in , however , for those who are trying to sell , little credit to pay tribute . quebecer seem 2010 have pushed the 
<finished>: two - thirds of the population , there is , in fact , the commitment to the environment of the firms as well as the greens unternehmenswerbung , so those responsible consumer centre at the university of sherbrooke sophisticated measure of betrays the pay little faith to quebecer . 
<finished>: another finding : half of consumers is casting doubt on the reliability of the official , to the supposedly fair products but also the credibility of the products and brands , which are as severe as the barometer to declare , attached certificates . 
<finished>: according to the same pattern of the discourse of the politicians on this issue of only fourteen , 6 % of the quebecer population , are taken seriously . 
<finished>: the information about responsible consumption , it seems , however , important to stimulate this konsumsegments , currently governed by nearly one third of quebecer consumers is activated . 
<finished>: in fact , dämpften empty and dubious nature of the information the zeal of six percent of the consumers . 
<finished>: this is after the higher price of the products of the second , on the part of the endeavouring identified brakes . 
<finished>: in addition , it is a third of the quebecer performance of green products and services , the one you by the hand to lay is committed to meeting with mistrust . indicated the 
<finished>: according to a different communication has already had more than half of consumers in their habits and brand of one or several products change , in order of their conviction to give the predominantly changed our noses . 
<finished>: according to the barometer , they had also to sixty - one percent purchases in traders in their stadtviertels and the purchase of in their region , cultivated food preferred favours . 
<finished>: green and responsible - the index of the environmentally friendly consumption had in this year of the maximalwertes homo consumus of quebec loves it , as king of the recycling , to present the is trying to protect its in the environment traces to reduce it by themselves for the welfare of animals , cares about left - hundred achieved by a performed . 
<finished>: but the social and environmental awareness seems nevertheless before his car stop so as to make the barometer : it was just time quebecer have indicated , in public transport or the mitfahrzentrale prefers to have , in order to their ecological interest to use 2010 the 28 % demonstrate . 
<finished>: the on foot , as well as the cycling , have also been the one per cent of the participants of this comprehensive verhaltensumfrage advocates , the stereotypes , of draws . 
<finished>: government loan for the takeover of excentris 
<finished>: the government , by the société angus , as well as the company parallèle was called upon to do it , to the adoption of the kinokomplexes excentris explains with a cooperation agreement , but only in the form of a competitive , to participate financially is quebecer loan . 
<finished>: the company , which is a donation to the tune of seven million dollars by the kultusministerium of daniel langlois kinokomplexes excentris on the boulevard saint - laurent had hoped for , in order for this once again its actual cineastischen function to receive , apparently not what they have asked for . stipulations as to make up for adoption parallèle entwicklergesellschaft angus , as well as the 
<finished>: the government has , in this matter too , however , to their own conditions are accepted . 
<finished>: instead of the expected donation provides the government rather than the hoped - for level , which is a viable solution to the conditions could , at least in the opinion of the from the state scaremongers entnehmbaren sources call will be advantageous to initially in lower borrowing quebecer . 
<finished>: a first action plan , as well as a question after twelve , eight million were already last spring by the quebec , the bittgesuch has been since the incorrect utilisation downwards once again has been rejected . 
<finished>: a proposal , together with an action plan have already been approved by the president of the ' société de développement des entreprises culturelles ' ( sodec ) , françois macerola , to minister st - pierre is being sent to the acts of excentris guides . 
<finished>: several days ago , he had to present her with a last technical report . 
<finished>: the counter - proposal of the cabinet has been the sodec , however , on wednesday . 
<finished>: parallèle and angus have now until december , at this time to answer . 
<finished>: in any case , it seems that the premise of the staatsspende really pushed aside . 
<finished>: let us bear in mind that the quebecer eigentümergemeinschaft cinemas and kinokomplexe against a direct staatsinvestition in support of the takeover of excentris had an argument , the ministers of education does not have any financial aid for immobilienprojekte there to make it not also other cinemas have to send out earlier by the uprising . 
<finished>: several other market participants of the segment , there have been , however , in contrast to the substantial economic assistance . 
<finished>: kinochef daniel langlois had after the construction of the cinema on ten years under great difficulties , the autorenkino in the premises of his kinokomplexes presented what 's unique position on the part of the treasury could justify eigenfinanzierten . 
<finished>: the lack of cinemas , the independent films show in montreal , is more than obvious , and excentris knew his clientele in the piles to keep . 
<finished>: the société angus , as well as the company parallèle with christian yaccarini at the top , taxes , for its part , a private - funded campagne , of which you are a sum of seven hundred thousand dollars is hoping for , in order to make the acquisition to stimulate growth . 
<finished>: since the spring 2009 drives only a single canvas , films in to show : le parallèle excentris continues . 
<finished>: the aim of the future purchasers , it is , the three cinemas february of next year , with the projection of the very successful film of xavier beauvois ' des hommes et des dieux ' to re - open 27 on . 
<finished>: christian yaccarini but has the newspaper ' le devoir ' not ignored what he and his group of the revised downwards proposals , which they made , and we charged . 
<finished>: mystery of the komplexgeschüttelten canada lifted 
<finished>: the new , american diplomatenleitungen , wikileaks , on the question of what the united nations under the inferiority complex of the canadians , with the americans , but with the same blow the feeling of superiority towards canada open . the latter are ; they consider secret to reveal the spread by 
<finished>: the american diplomats surprised that the ballot is not the canadian - american relations , and they believe that the visit by president obama , should have been the conservative government helped their budget by 2009 has , in the sense of the canadian voters are , consequently , enforce ! 
<finished>: the four new communications between the american embassy in ottawa and washington , who yesterday publicly , still offer more pikante details as the mere substantial content , to which it is a very bad outcome has been widespread . 
<finished>: a september 2008 datierende link , d . h . in the period , in which the federal wahlkampage is in full swing , was reported from the united nations is not more to the of their political leaders have discussed operations involved point about , what the ultra . the 22 . 
<finished>: the great surprise of david wilkins , of the american ambassador in ottawa used . 
<finished>: mr wilkins offers various erklärungsmöglichkeiten this situation . 
<finished>: " a nearly innewohnender inferiority complex , perhaps the canadian , political leaders are much more likely to have to speak about this , as the united states in this election , the ( such as in the campaign on the free trade ) ' , so he describes 1988 buck everyday life of the internal disputes led due to the canadians . 
<finished>: the united nations , so he , " the proverbial goliath of this election : omnipresent , but has the potential to cause , in order to talk about him " , therefore , are also concludes . 
<finished>: the ambassador , understands this ' deafening silence ' , the less likely it is that , since the two countries intensive political and economic relations .

<finished>: " we have a candidate , and there are with the ump no discussions about ' , responded immediately and careful the environment of the prime minister . 
<finished>: " if he is a defeat as possible , he would not be a candidate , " jean - pierre raffarin , shares would find themselves with . 
<finished>: " he will always prevail to be corrected , alain juppé , who is with the offenkundigkeit resigned , can believe in it , " said . 
<finished>: euro : the european central bank has been forced to give up their acquisitions of government securities to maintain 
<finished>: the last of the ecb in the last year , should be an opportunity for you from the crisis , or at least a large number of non - conventional measures of monetary policy at the end of the year to their conclusion is supposed to come from . to announce an order emerges as opportunities to show zentralbankrats assembly of the 
<finished>: the crisis of the european sovereign debt , the european central bank in frankfurt , it can not afford to pay , including the current government , more than on the european bond markets to verwirken , in order not to their worsening situation a tense undoubtedly is committed to seeking . 
<finished>: the political costs would be far too high . 
<finished>: the french finance minister christine lagarde had yesterday , on the occasion of a press conference by the ecb , to play an active role in favour of the solution of the staatshaushaltsverschuldung europe 's stance is to be welcomed . 
<finished>: it has not dared to say , whether you are of the opinion that the central bank could do more , for example , by boosting their programme of acquisitions of government bonds was . 
<finished>: " i would like to reserve my considerations for my european trading partners before ( . . . ) " . 
<finished>: jean - claude trichet , president of the ecb , in brussels , on the occasion of his hearing by the committee on economic and monetary affairs of the european parliament is not very eloquently demonstrated , but to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities on the secondary market , " " would , and that we in the assembly on thursday " to see how the decisions to be ' . however , on the contrary , she projects on his previous had on 
<finished>: only one certainty : the ecb will make its rates unchanged , the lowest level since may leave within one per cent . 
<finished>: in practice , what has so far been the obligationskäufe the from the ecb last week on approximately , billions of euros payment doubled . 
<finished>: and according to leaks of some traders to you yesterday , new purchases of irish and portuguese government securities have made . 
<finished>: overall , the central banks of the eurosystem since may last year purchases in the sum of eur 67 billion . 
<finished>: under the traders will be the anticipation of the kaufkurses questioned ( see page 29 ) no refer . 
<finished>: the economists expect no remarkable change in direction for more . 
<finished>: if the anleihengeschäfte of about three months already from the arsenal of the ecb will have disappeared , to the full geldmittelreserven on freigiebige kind to create over a period of a week for up to three months . while make , and still will be the latter 
<finished>: the economists are already today , that this measure is still for a couple of months taken to extend it . 
<finished>: " i cannot imagine that the ecb of its programme of work on the essential nature of ‘non - will ' . 
<finished>: " otherwise , it would take the risk of new tensions in the short term , " michael schubert , economist of commerzbank suspected , so to provoke . 
<finished>: " a for the course of the first quarter 2011 , seems to me to be more likely to " , for its part , norbert bräms , an economist at sca meetings anticipated exit forms of more progressive . 
<finished>: oppenheim . 
<finished>: in the area of their interventions in the market of the national debt , " the ecb should such a kaufvolumen to bonds aufrechthalten , the sluggish market crowded , " adds norbert bräms added . 
<finished>: in view of the relevance of the european banks on the markets of the public debt in the euro zone , the central bank has no other choice , as their presence on the market to maintain a position on exposed . 
<finished>: " they must at any price to the steller the lack of investors in the market and the enthusiasm on the most vulnerable countries to prevent ' , yesterday an important obligationeninhaber . leadership that returns are paid to the premature nature of such action , in order to enter 
<finished>: because if the interest rates on the soaring , will the member states even more are prevented from going to their debt to reduce or even just start to stabilise . 
<finished>: this is the price we have to pay for the protection of the euro . 
<finished>: the berlusconi government is in italy in cover 
<finished>: after a worrying wochenanfang has the situation yesterday with the decline of eckzinsen on ten years of italy for a little relaxation . 
<finished>: a return to the deceptive quiet . 
<finished>: at the end of the meeting with the minister for economic affairs had the regionsvorsitzenden giulio tremonti , the situation as a " unentzifferbar ' him with a " unpredictable " weekend have expected to hear and listen to what the person in question , however , was denied by immediately and to qualify . 
<finished>: on tuesday , in any case , would have been the gap with the german interest rates , its record of 210 base points achieved , and the prices of the treaties in order to meet the konkursrisikos 263 points , which is a certain kopflosigkeit in rome caused to be had . 
<finished>: silvio berlusconi had in his council of ministers pointed out that the discrepancy in spain to the german interest rates in 400 base points . 
<finished>: his right hand , gianni letta , however , as a " deeply concerned " by the " market turbulence " and a possible contagion from the direction of ireland expressed itself had . 
<finished>: " the good news is that , in italy , the third economy in the euro zone , not like greece or ireland is . " 
<finished>: " the bad news is that , in italy , such as portugal , irwin stelzer , an economist at the hudson institute , said it is " . 
<finished>: to put it in plain language , the problem is the absenz of economic growth , and the attendant , schwindsüchtigen steuereingänge , the power of the state in danger , his finance will no longer be , means being able to cover . 
<finished>: the last brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government . 
<finished>: in future , there will be a growth of 1.1 % in 2011 and of one point four per cent in years 2012 expected . . . although this in the senate on the examination of this budget , or italian 2 % counts . 
<finished>: under these conditions , so the eu commission , will be the fiscal deficit in the next year , 3 % of gdp ( contrary to the governments of the forecasted 3.9 % ) and three and a half per cent in 2012 ( instead of 2.7 % ) 4 still calculated . 
<finished>: hence , also , the turmoil of a new haushaltskollektiv that after the holidays to a sum of seven billion euro could be used . 
<finished>: " if necessary , must come up with new austerity measures to be taken , " says accountants , olli rehn . 
<finished>: on the hour receives italy the support of international institutions . 
<finished>: " the very foundations of italy 's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated , we already have for a long time , " assured arrigo sadun , italian trustee of the international monetary fund , the imf , with italy , to repeat , this is entrusted . 
<finished>: " at the moment , there are no problems , either on the short - term , still on a long - term point of view , because of italy , despite its high debt levels ( two per cent of the gdp , a . d . ) lower than from other countries ' pier carlo padoan , head - economist of the oecd observed , be called r . stabilisationsfortschritte 2011 in years , located . 
<finished>: there remains the question of the political unstetigkeit . 
<finished>: december will silvio berlusconi is a motion of no confidence in the chamber of deputies of the elections as early as the end of march , could be staged . preferred to face as a result of which . on fourteen 
<finished>: it is , therefore , a little bit of good period for a decision to be taken in relation to a serious crisis before . 
<finished>: europeans are thinking about the development of the anti - crisis measures after 
<finished>: christine lagarde had it within the framework of a press conference in paris : " i believe that it is still on , and also on the evening : the europeans are ready and committed , their currency and their zone to defend ' , clearly demonstrated to keep together sonntagnachmittag highlighted explicitly yesterday , still . 
<finished>: although completely relatively - the withdrawal of european staatsobligationen was grist to the mill of the governments , as well as the zinsfüßen yesterday recorded in the ecb . 
<finished>: from a normalisierungsbeginn can , however , does not yet have the speech . 
<finished>: the credit rating agency standard & poor 's had announced that it could be the schuldenvermerk portugal , no doubt , the most effective target of speculators nowadays , lower . 
<finished>: " there is a lack of clarity and political visibility , particularly on the banking systems ' , so the opinion of the economists of the exane bnp paribas rests real as in may . 
<finished>: above all , especially as " the political time much more slowly than the markets ' passes . 
<finished>: the european countries , which are both of this gap , as well as the risk of , well , are aware of the discussions on the strengthening of the existing anti - crisis measures to step up conceals the fact that is . 
<finished>: the informal discussions between the finance ministers and in the broader sense with their opposite numbers in the world are progressing well affected most direct . 
<finished>: and this , too , in the meetings of the council and ecofin at the beginning of next week , eurogroupe terms . 
<finished>: the ecb is true today . 
<finished>: on the plan is the fate of the non - traditional measures of the countries in the euro zone a bulls eye of the markets ( see below ) backing to . 
<finished>: what the eu has its executive director , klaus regling already on tuesday in his asia tour started in the far east on the developments with regard to the crisis in europe , to inform investors about the singapour so far , stability fund . 
<finished>: if the aim of his visit , although not explicit fundraising is , so is he this , certainly , to the ground . 
<finished>: the first werpapierausgaben on the part of the eu financial stability fund , are for next month . 
<finished>: yesterday was an official representative of the agency , the united states supported a possible increase in the additional , direct commitment of the imf mobilised by the tasks entrusted to reuters american fund . 
<finished>: portugal and spain , the countries in the first series , in turn , structural reforms , particularly in the area of the arbeitsmarktorganisation is sending to take over . 
<finished>: the reforms to the austerity measures are added , however , effects in the near future are supposed to show . 
<finished>: lisbon and madrid , a different path , as this is the case of greece and ireland have done . 
<finished>: both , as well as the other is at any price point to avoid international assistance to their own budgetkorrektive on structural reforms have decided that you , in the long term , the confidence is unavoidable , and they must , before asking for a set the restores . 
<finished>: the european investors , in turn , have complained about the available options , in order to drive the normalisation process of the markets of government bonds to be speeded up . 
<finished>: weber , the november in paris , had the idea that if the by europe and the international monetary fund is not enough , in this way the union would not hesitate to once again into their own pockets to be mobilised billion euro state , produced the first was on the eve of the transit axel resort . 
<finished>: the economists from barclays capital , in terms of the market of european sovereign debt , actor , an extension of the hundred billion euros would be enough , " preferably " in the form of a direct liquiditätsspritze . judge , who was very much to the fore 
<finished>: this means there is : the european mechanism finanzstabilisierung , which currently sixty billion is being . 
<finished>: an advisory board , all of the attention in the european capitals to be investigated , opportunities has . 
<finished>: above all , if the market conditions worsen . 
<finished>: snow and black ice : 24 departments in alert level orange 
<finished>: the snow - draw still , in particular in the secondary networks of brittany and threatening to various economic activities to be difficulty after episodes of prejudice . 
<finished>: twenty - four in orange because of the threat of a snow - and glatteisrisikos alert departments are now . 
<finished>: the regions - et - loir , deux - sèvres and vienne are already in twenty since wednesday afternoon , and two , the dordogne and the gironde , then later in the night , . eighteen evolved to alert the orange socks departments ; your your , 
<finished>: according to france , to the north of the gironde , as well as the charentes , it is snowing easily on the et ile - de - france schneeschauer touch the intense météo . 
<finished>: in the affected by two to five cm , also of seven to ten centimetres expected , as well as between one and three , five cm in the paris region to cm , even by some places schneedecken departments will be . 
<finished>: the regions of charente , charente - maritime , côtes armor finistère , gironde , dordogne , and the regions of poitou lower normandy , ile - de - france and limousin , d ' , are affected . 
<finished>: the snowfall early this are remarkable enough , in order to traffic jams and certain economic activities to affect , says météo france ahead of provoking . 
<finished>: in the region , the côtes armor regionalstrassen for the heavy traffic , including the transport routes guingamp - lannion and saint - brieuc - loudéac . , half tonnes of over seven blocked several are d ' 
<finished>: the secondary networks in brittany is , according to the verkehrspolizisten , the vehicle only in the very difficult , and the use of some of the ter - coaches has been the whole day on , notfalle to use their own counsel , covering the deleted . 
<finished>: in the picardy was the schulverkehr for thursday lifted . 
<finished>: for the heavy traffic on wednesday evening , no specific restrictive measures provided for . 
<finished>: the prefect of ' calls for caution on the streets , as well as to the appropriate adjustment of their fahrverhaltens on . the highest of the drivers to " 
<finished>: the directorate - general for civil aviation ( dgac ) called for the airlines , on thursday by the paris airport roissy and ten percent of orly from flights because of the expected strong snowfall early this destined to delete their 25 % . 
<finished>: the dgab recommends that the airline passengers , their airline to contact . 
<finished>: the airports gatwick in the south of london , as well as the airport in edinburgh , scotland , are closed until thursday morning . 
<finished>: métro grand paris : first financial skizzen 
<finished>: since the debate about the modernisation of the transport industry on the ile - de - france is in full swing , it rains billion . 
<finished>: at least in the discussions . 
<finished>: we call , in particular , for the metro paris in memory , the société du grand paris to be built by the grand billion this reproduction . 
<finished>: in order to start to construction of the calvinist in the ways of the state has a kapitaldotation of four billion euros , to guide has been declared . 
<finished>: in the theoretical scheme , this is the sum of the calvinist then that would allow for the markets is a part of the amount of money on her two - fold . 
<finished>: today , it is finally to first projections from has come . 
<finished>: the amending budget , this morning by the financial commission of the national assembly , contains the measures laid down in the first part of this , in order to be reviewed in the light of 2010 amounts . 
<finished>: it is two measures : the creation of a tax on erschließund and an increase in taxation of offices at the ile de france , in order to be here . 
<finished>: the former , fifteen of the bill , is " for the benefit of the public - service clinic société du grand paris ' article withdraw it . 
<finished>: this is a figure : " the product of this tax amounts to millions of euros per year , positive " . 
<finished>: it is an overhaul of the already existing taxation : ' in order to modernise it from their product , and to increase , this increase of the société du grand paris to future generations ' means the , in order to see . 
<finished>: how much would the table ? 
<finished>: a mystery to me . 
<finished>: this amount is not in the text . 
<finished>: out of the four billion is to be far away from that . 
<finished>: " it will be the fiscal resources to billions of euros of kapitaldotation , the state has to be found and the société du grand paris after and after for the project to be done " , so is the explanatory statement to the sum will be added by 4 the that carried out , can be inferred . 
<finished>: in the calvinist will take place this system does not offensive . 
<finished>: " since the moment , in revenue ( the two taxes , d . , r . ) , on for three years , and then only for the four billion gain ' , so will cover them can be chalked up to the one they explained . 
<finished>: " this will be in the budget to be noted and after and after pulled out ' . 
<finished>: the calvinist that 2013 started , will be the four billion for the budget 2014 to note , it is estimated . 
<finished>: this measure , which 4 promised billions of people for a long time yet , will be able to seek , runs the risk of a right of distraction , parliamentary debate . 
<finished>: the first public meeting will take place on the seventh of december instead . 
<finished>: rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies 
<finished>: the affair wikileaks has a double meaning . 
<finished>: on one side , it proved to be an obvious scandal , a scandal , the only a scandal in the sinner hypocrisy is between the member states , to the citizens and the press governed beziehunge , the turns . 
<finished>: on the other hand , has announced that it will require profound changes at international level , and there is a foretaste of the future by recession dominated . 
<finished>: but we are going in the right order . 
<finished>: the first aspect is the confirmation of the fact that it is difficult to carry out any of a secret service file ( a nation ) exclusively from press cuttings of any x - produced by wikileaks of composed . 
<finished>: the " extraordinary " , american revelations about the sexual habits of berlusconi 's throw , nothing more than what we are about in each of the journal to read ( except those whose owners ) , and the terrifying karikaturierte profile gaddafi 's bot kabarettkünstlern already for a long time for their sketche . substance is berlusconi was any x - anyway , months after 
<finished>: the rule , according to the the already well - known news , is essential for the dynamics of the secret services , and this is not only in the course of this century must be from secret dossiers only . 
<finished>: if you are in a library esotherischen publications will be that each of the grail , the mystery of rennes - le - chateau , the templer or the rosenkreuzler ) exactly the repeated , to what is already enshrined in previous works has been written about , you see , is dedicated to the work ( go . 
<finished>: this is not alone , therefore , that the author of occult texts do not publish ( still , therefore , that he not , where news on the non - existent ) , but because those who are the okkultismus to believe what you already know and confirmed what they already have learned the nothing other than to devote to , would be to find knew wants to research . 
<finished>: this is also the erfolgsmechanismus of dan brown . 
<finished>: as well as the secret files . 
<finished>: the informant is lazy , and lazy ( or limited intellect ) is also the head of the intelligence service ( otherwise he could , for example , editor in libération ) , the only true , what he considered to be something which is also increasingly recognises . 
<finished>: the top - secret information about mr berlusconi , the american embassy in rome the staatsdezernat had , were the same as those who newsweek already sent the week before , was published . 
<finished>: so why was such a fuss about the revelations of these dossiers made ? 
<finished>: on one side of each person , and that the messages - at least since the end of the second world war , and since then , too , the heads of state or government of each other or a plane , in order to function , with the exception of some small classed in spionagezentren have turned , and have lost their diplomatic meeting - dinner can take to be able , while already know what state this , well - educated . 
<finished>: viewers of ermittlungsfilmen knows this very well , and it is not for hypocrisy , this is the way to do this is to ignore any number of each . 
<finished>: nevertheless , the fact that it publicly , to repeat , the task of the hypocrisy and serves to protect the american diplomacy in a bad light , to be violated . 
<finished>: the idea that a hackers the secrets of the most powerful country in the world , carries with it the significant blow against the prestige of the staatsdezernats can tap geheimsten x - random : to second place . 
<finished>: in addition , the scandal is less the victims , rather than the ' executioner " in trouble . 
<finished>: but we have the in - depth nature of what has happened . 
<finished>: former times , all power , such as a " big brother " pool , every gesture of his subjects , we could , to george orwell’s controlled . 
<finished>: george orwell’s prophecy since then as absolutely the right , where movement , thanks to the telephone , every transaction , the hotel , the elected motorway and so on and so forth ; the citizens would express its total victims to the eye of power will be visited made can control every one can prove to be had . 
<finished>: however , if you look at what that even the secret krypten the power is no longer the control of a hackers able to escape the kontrollgang on , one - sided to be directed and will zirkelförmig . listens as is happening today , bearing in mind 
<finished>: the power of every citizen , but each and every citizen , or at least the avenger by many of the citizen - , can the secrets of the power in as a hacker acquired control of experience . 
<finished>: how can , however , be a power , which is no longer in its own secrets to maintain ? 
<finished>: it is true , has already said that a real secret is a mystery is ( and a secret can never be ) ; it is also true , however , that any knowledge about the nature of berlusconi 's or , in fact , a secret , unfettered by geheimis is , since it is the public sphere ; but in the wikileaks secrets of hillary clinton empty secrets were , means that they are of any power to deprive the , that of vintage publishing summaries merkel reveals an empty empty simmel georg . 
<finished>: wikileaks has neither sarkozy nor merkel wrong done , clinton and obama , as opposed to . 
<finished>: what will be the consequences of this affront to be a case of this enormous power has been done ? 
<finished>: it is obvious that the member states in future no longer reserved for information online posts will be - that would be a lack of the street corner angeklebten posting of guilt . 
<finished>: but it is also clear that , with the current technologies in vain to hope for is confidential reports on the phone to keep secret . 
<finished>: nothing is easier than to find out whether , and when , as a head of state , in a plane and one of his colleagues , has been in contact with 's . 
<finished>: how could in future private and only for certain ears certain relationships ? 
<finished>: i am very well aware that my prediction at the moment , according to science - fiction and romanhaft sounds , but i see myself , i am the regierungsagenten on secret way to uncontrollable marschrouten moving , their communications , as in the memory with varied viewpoints , and , moreover , the few written information they have received , in schuhabsatz verbergend is mere nowhere else score and , to present forced to do this . 
<finished>: the information would be in single copy in closed cupboards : basically spionageversuch of watergate less success has been made , as the had stored wikileaks . 
<finished>: i have had the opportunity to write that the technology these days as a cancer progresses , namely backwards . 
<finished>: a century after the wireless communications , reconstructed the internet a telegrafen with ( telephone ) had revolutionised telegraf wire . 
<finished>: the ( analogue ) cassettes , had the film bond for bond , forward spulen and all the secrets of the installation , while the ( numerical ) cds nowadays , nothing else from chapter to chapter , in other words makroportionen to jump as possible , has been able to lift the probe by one of a filmforschern allows . 
<finished>: with the high - speed trains within the space of three hours from rome to milan , while this plane , including of switching three - and - a - half hours by one drives requires . 
<finished>: it is not , therefore , exceptionally , that policy and communications technology to car and horse to come back . 
<finished>: a final observation . 
<finished>: in previous times attempted to get the press to understand what for secrets between the embassies are being forged . 
<finished>: at present , there are the messages , the confidential information of the press are calling for . 
<finished>: climate : how france his finanzversprechen schönredet 
<finished>: a year after the copenhagen treaty , it is time the observance of quickly financing pledge ( also " almost start ' funding to the developing countries have been implemented . the study , called ) or premature resolved 
<finished>: and already are the rough french schönredereien revealed . 
<finished>: with the copenhagen treaty have the developing countries are obliged to thirty billion dollars between 2010 and 2012 available . 
<finished>: the eu has billions of euros over three years , promised france 1.26 billions of euros ( d . h . million per year ) . there 2 seventh , 
<finished>: on the occasion of the opening of the eu has , in order to their partners from the fact of their commitment with regard to the almost - to convince the member states of the press conference , great nebenevents , broschürenverteilung vorgehensbericht : start - up funding detailgetreuer drawn all register cop16 . 
<finished>: the operation is transparent and for their actual value estimated : the developing countries and the civil society , if all the developed countries have the same on the same präzisionsniveau like to see it come is remarkable . 
<finished>: the eu announced that in the years eur two billion released to have , what you are on the right path to respektbezollung their commitment of seven , two billion in 2012 brings , 2010 . 
<finished>: but if we have to go into detail about looks , things are a little more complicated . 
<finished>: according to the copenhagen treaty and , in addition , in order to ensure that an additional use has been tabled , without , to the detriment of public development aid to be ' new ' should this money be . 
<finished>: unfortunately , there is no consensus on what to do , " new and additional " means . 
<finished>: while the eu commission , a harmonisation of certain member states , including france , have proposed that the procedure has been blocked . 
<finished>: choosing today everyone the benchmark , the he , as the best thing to do . 
<finished>: the eu commission has , for example , as a benchmark for those of the year : the international finance will be maintained , and within the framework of funding ' almost - start ' on for three years , is selected as the 2009 150m to do so . 
<finished>: other countries have similar benchmarks , either in terms of year or about conditions at the level of public development aid will be elected . 
<finished>: france was of the opinion that the funding ' of all new projects , " the year 2010 were " new and additional " to do this in return . 
<finished>: in other words : there is no benchmarks in the expenditure of the year or at the global level , public development aid to the previous one . 
<finished>: can the sum total of the french support for the developing countries remain stable ( or decrease ) - france , his commitment with regard to the ' new and additional funding to comply with " before there is said to be concrete . 
<finished>: another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans . 
<finished>: there is still no rule , and every elects its rechenmodus . 
<finished>: some , such as , for example , france , are 1 borrowed being as equivalent to being donated . 
<finished>: obviously , this is difficult to acceptable : the trouble is not comparable . 
<finished>: if the use of loans for certain profitable investment ( often to the projects , the technology is based ) can be justified , it is deceptive , the euro has to be known as the equivalent of a euro . . only the cost of the loan for the kapitalgeberland as a commitment to be counted ( d . h . the equivalent of an interest rate ) . should the theft donated , and , in addition , to actually present at emissionseindämmung tied 
<finished>: but france has in mind , as the following consideration : it ' respect ' its commitment of millions of euros , five percent loans ( 389 , eight million euros ) and eight and a half percent donates ) one million euros ) - see also the eu document to convince themselves that 36 , by 91 there different nothing . 
<finished>: france is the only country in the eu , that loans to a great extent . 
<finished>: germany , denmark , the netherlands , or in the case of slovakia ( among other things ) to their obligations to one hundred percent with donations , while six percent . 
<finished>: in other words , if the vast majority of the european union to fulfil their obligations are france just ten cents and understands including a comparable , spends 1€ use . 
<finished>: beautiful hokuspokus ! 
<finished>: all in all , the absence of france in his almost - start - up financing with a double : to a part of the action on the time and , on the other part of the reality of the financial commitment weiterentwicklkung with a rip - off . 
<finished>: france will succeed in it , that millions of " new and additional " million in accordance with its promise has spent and saves it 36.1 millions of euro . there to believe 
<finished>: the manipulation of the finance ministry ( as seems to be that it was , has carried out a double negative effect once ( why other member states with the donations continuing , if it ? ) and then , in the negotiations , given that the developing countries are not completely deceived . . . to borrow , however , is enough to make the drive - internally eu ; could the arbitration of bercy probably it ) 
<finished>: the chapter of the funding is only a small issue on a relatively short period of time , compared to the whole of the discussions on the climate began . 
<finished>: but it could be the drop too much in the huge machine of the unfccc . 
<finished>: we hope that this will not be the case . 
<finished>: as always , it is absolutely vital that his lesson to be learnt from this first year of premature funding was the also to learn . 
<finished>: in the first instance france could be a change in his verbuchungsart 2011 and 2012 in a spirit of respect for its obligations and the justice with the other countries in the european union , balancing while , and announce the for years . 
<finished>: above all , however , france could the discussions on the subject of a dispute with the long - term financing ( another crucial issue ) : we can escape the question of the ' verrechenbarkeit ' or the verbuchungsart his loans not discussed at the moment and to bring forward . 
<finished>: france could alter its position so that – just ahead of the curve in terms of the disputes to be , as it is the other things . 
<finished>: the hope is based , therefore , on the new environment minister kosciusko - morizet , the next week in cancún will arrive . 
<finished>: a surprising announcement on the almost - start france and his vision of " verrechenbarkeit ' , as well as the use of loans would , by their nature , from the international trust , which is necessary for continued discussions is going to increase . 
<finished>: alarm - of children 's pesticides 
<finished>: a child of ten years ago , on the day a , this wednesday générations futures ( former movement for the protection of human rights and of respect for future generations ) study published an association of the so different chemical substances , a private takes . 
<finished>: the association , that their results " , given the low number of samples , no statistically significant value but illustrationscharakter issue , between july and september is normally in the space of four , from a child to the food consumed , plus an zwischenmahlzeit in supermarkets in oise and paris bought meals around ten years had dealt with ' the perilously analysed declared the . 
<finished>: this is typical of the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and , three of the five litres of water per day , as well as biscuits from laboratories in search of chemical substances , pesticides , heavy metals and other contaminants were - , dairy products and obstteilen including meals - investigated .
