<seg id="1"> A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama </seg>
<seg id="2"> Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, the Brennan Centre considers this a myth, stating that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Indeed, Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade. </seg>
<seg id="5"> One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turn-out. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Unlike in Canada, the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult. </seg>
<seg id="9"> This phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives added in 26 States. </seg>
<seg id="10"> As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The new election laws require voters to show a photo ID card and proof of US citizenship. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Furthermore, these laws also reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Before the 2006 elections, no US State required voters to show a photo ID card. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Indiana was the first State to impose such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 States to force voters to show a photo ID card. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not possess a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification. </seg>
<seg id="21"> And it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes. </seg>
<seg id="23"> In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required photo ID card. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And that's not all. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Students, voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution. </seg>
<seg id="26"> On the other hand, these same States allow fishing or hunting club members, who vote more Republican, to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Prior to 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Since 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens. </seg>
<seg id="30"> These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote. </seg>
<seg id="31"> However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic party. </seg>
<seg id="32"> What is more, in 2011 Republican legislators sponsored laws abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight States. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register. </seg>
<seg id="34"> These restrictions are not without consequence. </seg>
<seg id="35"> For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to registering around 10 million citizens. </seg>
<seg id="36"> However, the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of early voters were African-Americans, who accounted however for only 13% of voters in the State. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The same applied to Hispanics. </seg>
<seg id="40"> These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted early. </seg>
<seg id="41"> On the other hand, 76% of voters were white but these represented only 46% of early voters. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Several bills were blocked by vetoes of Democratic governors. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The United States Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They were able to partially limit the damage. </seg>
<seg id="46"> For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card. </seg>
<seg id="47"> However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influencing the 2012 results in key States. </seg>
<seg id="49"> A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the Presidency. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turn-out. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Prostate cancer screening: take the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Indeed, the PSA test sometimes shows erroneous results with false negative or even false positive results, which involve unnecessary medical interventions. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Enough to make already reluctant men hesitate to take screening tests. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Take the test or not? </seg>
<seg id="57"> We asked two specialists for their opinion. </seg>
<seg id="58"> In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Another study, this time a European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who were not. </seg>
<seg id="60"> This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that it is between 30 and 40% more likely for metastases to occur in the absence of screening. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I therefore recommend the test from age 50, or 40 if you have a direct relative who previously had prostate cancer. </seg>
<seg id="62"> African-American men are also more at risk. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected. </seg>
<seg id="64"> There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the options available, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that are not long-term life threatening, and opting instead, in such cases, for active monitoring of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Today, many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Active monitoring will be suggested, and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment. </seg>
<seg id="68"> More and more, specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Therefore I recommend taking the test. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it. </seg>
<seg id="71"> In collaboration with the Société internationale d'urologie [SIU], Movember has created a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test. </seg>
<seg id="72"> You can download the document (in English for the time being, a [French] translation will be available shortly) at this address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening </seg>
<seg id="73"> Preventing the disease </seg>
<seg id="74"> Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Despite the progress in research, the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it. </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is estimated that if everyone ate well and exercised enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented. </seg>
<seg id="77"> "If no more people smoked, this rate would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society. </seg>
<seg id="78"> On the other hand, it is estimated that roughly 10% of cancers are hereditary. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Some are also completely unexplained. </seg>
<seg id="80"> For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Cigarettes are linked to 85% of lung cancer cases. </seg>
<seg id="82"> It is also a risk factor for a number of others. </seg>
<seg id="83"> This massively damages people's health. </seg>
<seg id="84"> "Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec" deplores spokesperson André Beaulieu. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Encouraging data: 10 years after giving up smoking, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Weight </seg>
<seg id="87"> Overweight and obesity are also conducive to the onset of the disease, according to the SCC. </seg>
<seg id="88"> They can increase the risks of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus. </seg>
<seg id="89"> "Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protects against colon cancer" it is also said. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Diet </seg>
<seg id="91"> The organisation also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat. </seg>
<seg id="92"> In large amounts, it increases the risks of developing colo-rectal cancer. </seg>
<seg id="93"> Likewise, so do cured meat products, and these should be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="94"> The conservation of meat by smoking, drying or curing can cause the formation of carcinogens. </seg>
<seg id="95"> "They can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer" it is explained. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Vitamins </seg>
<seg id="97"> In recent years, a number of scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer. </seg>
<seg id="98"> For the time being however their research is inconclusive. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC. </seg>
<seg id="100"> While one study noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Also the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear. </seg>
<seg id="102"> In addition, Mr Beaulieu emphasises the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doctor. </seg>
<seg id="103"> "Taking a screening test doesn't give you cancer." </seg>
<seg id="104"> The Higgs boson revealed </seg>
<seg id="105"> The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer, and with good reason. </seg>
<seg id="106"> Indeed, it is believed that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, no less. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Also it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically. </seg>
<seg id="108"> But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs. </seg>
<seg id="109"> We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new authentic particle, and greatly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model. </seg>
<seg id="110"> In addition, new data unveiled this week at a large physics Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure. </seg>
<seg id="111"> But let's suppose that it really is the Higgs, since the chances of being mistaken seem slim, and see what it is. </seg>
<seg id="112"> In our world, there is a fatally unavoidable law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="113"> There's no way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you'll go mad. </seg>
<seg id="114"> However, even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of certain of their characteristics. </seg>
<seg id="115"> Based on this, physicists classify particles into two categories. </seg>
<seg id="116"> In one corner we have good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle. </seg>
<seg id="117"> While lurking in the other are the bosons, a nasty band of anarchists who respect nothing - at all events, not this principle, which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="118"> These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the Berkeley Labs Particle Adventure site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way): mesons, which we will not discuss here, and "force particles" by which the great forces of nature are propagated and to which the Higgs boson may be somehow related. </seg>
<seg id="119"> These bosons, it must be stressed here, are not all such exotic bugs as you might think. </seg>
<seg id="120"> In fact, if you can read this article, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon, or the "light particle" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force. </seg>
<seg id="121"> When, in fact, a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, this "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this specific place, rather like a pebble thrown in a pond. </seg>
<seg id="122"> This "disturbance" produces an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and thus one of the "force carrier" bosons. </seg>
<seg id="123"> More stable field </seg>
<seg id="124"> The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for the boson to appear. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very, very high energy levels, rather like a frozen pond which would need a very large rock to wrinkle the surface. </seg>
<seg id="126"> Which is why a huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a 27km circumference! - is needed to achieve such energy levels. </seg>
<seg id="127"> The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs and mass. </seg>
<seg id="128"> In fact not all particles, or all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field. </seg>
<seg id="129"> Some, such as magnets, do so, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to a fridge. </seg>
<seg id="130"> And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do so have mass, while the others (such as the photon) do not. </seg>
<seg id="131"> Now, what is it that all this research "can bring"? asks Ms Plamondon. </seg>
<seg id="132"> For science, it serves to check the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and also allows physicians to examine any discrepancies between the observations and predictions of the SM. </seg>
<seg id="133"> A number of people, moreover, fervently hope that some will be found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug certain holes in the Model. </seg>
<seg id="134"> This, it must be said, still has huge shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms approximately 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-oops!). </seg>
<seg id="135"> But to date no such discrepancies have been found at CERN. </seg>
<seg id="136"> Repercussions </seg>
<seg id="137"> The repercussions of this research on the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there won't be any. </seg>
<seg id="138"> Remember: in the very early 60s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that would be triggered by their work. </seg>
<seg id="139"> They had an inkling of the scientific applications, but nothing as to the rest. </seg>
<seg id="140"> In fact, the late Willard Boyle - a physicist who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - told us that initially the laser was rather seen as a "lab gadget." </seg>
<seg id="141"> Just imagine... </seg>
<seg id="142"> And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds research. </seg>
<seg id="143"> For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics. </seg>
<seg id="144"> This sensor, although this was not at all the original intention, now serves as an "eye" to all digital cameras worldwide, and earned him the Nobel physics prize in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="145"> With its Dying with Dignity Commission, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life. </seg>
<seg id="146"> The debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared. </seg>
<seg id="147"> However, in this vital area, much remains to be done. </seg>
<seg id="148"> Le Devoir attempted to look more closely. </seg>
<seg id="149"> Just a few weeks ago Mr L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment. </seg>
<seg id="150"> The festering prostate cancer had allowed him a two-year respite. </seg>
<seg id="151"> "They gave me five years to live, I've made it to seven," he says, with mixed emotions, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day. </seg>
<seg id="152"> "But it's still a shock, you can never be prepared for it" he adds. </seg>
<seg id="153"> The disease is doing its work: huge weakness which prevents him going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone. </seg>
<seg id="154"> Sitting in front of an appetising lunch, he consents to being helped to eat, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="155"> Courageous, he even manages to smile, talks to the strangers bustling around him, bringing him his medication, offering him a bath. </seg>
<seg id="156"> The courage of ordinary death. </seg>
<seg id="157"> "What I want most is to be cured of my diarrhoea, it's humiliating" he confided. </seg>
<seg id="158"> A few hours later, the team found a cure for this illness. </seg>
<seg id="159"> "During our lives, we learn that a man pisses standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home. </seg>
<seg id="160"> Regressing to the stage of a child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation. </seg>
<seg id="161"> "It depends on the person's ability" to accept the regression, he says. </seg>
<seg id="162"> Because, in the opinion of a number of people working in palliative care, great moments occur at the very heart of such regression. </seg>
<seg id="163"> Patients at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer. </seg>
<seg id="164"> They have a maximum life expectancy of three months. </seg>
<seg id="165"> At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provides so-called "curative" care. </seg>
<seg id="166"> For Mrs A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocating." </seg>
<seg id="167"> But the disease has made me discover my children. </seg>
<seg id="168"> "I have fine children" she adds. </seg>
<seg id="169"> "I don't wish for anything more in life" she says, before accepting having a mask put on to help her breathe. </seg>
<seg id="170"> She looks forward nevertheless, in the next few days, to a last visit by her son coming from Italy. </seg>
<seg id="171"> At Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provides bodily care and help with feeding. </seg>
<seg id="172"> This is palliative care, given when there is nothing else that can be done. </seg>
<seg id="173"> To make death more comfortable. </seg>
<seg id="174"> In Quebec, there are palliative care beds for 11,700 inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="175"> This is very few when we know that we will all die one day. </seg>
<seg id="176"> Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the home. </seg>
<seg id="177"> Whether at a physical comfort, emotional or spiritual level. </seg>
<seg id="178"> A person who is dying will accept being helped to drink brandy or Pepsi, whatever is their tipple. </seg>
<seg id="179"> Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar. </seg>
<seg id="180"> And death is part of everyday life. </seg>
<seg id="181"> Yesterday evening, a beer was served to Mr X, who died during the night. </seg>
<seg id="182"> This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased. </seg>
<seg id="183"> "We help relatives as much as patients" says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care. </seg>
<seg id="184"> At the Victor-Gadbois home, one day follows another but no two are alike. </seg>
<seg id="185"> Along with a 93-year-old man who is savouring his last meeting with his family, sitting firmly wedged in his pillows while toasts are drunk in his honour, a 36-year-young man is dying tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything to survive. </seg>
<seg id="186"> "For six months, there have always been three to five beds which are occupied by cancer patients less than 45 years old" says a concerned Dr Christiane Martel. </seg>
<seg id="187"> 53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% from hospital. </seg>
<seg id="188"> Lack of access to palliative care </seg>
<seg id="189"> It is said that 77% of Canadians simply have no access to palliative care, which is care designed to ease the pain when a patient has reached the terminal stage of life, be it at home, in hospital or in a care home. </seg>
<seg id="190"> And a number of organisations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Palliative Care Society in Greater Montreal, specialise more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients. </seg>
<seg id="191"> It is precisely this large gap in Quebec health care which has made a number of palliative care physicians fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide. </seg>
<seg id="192"> Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care luminaries including Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative. </seg>
<seg id="193"> According to Dr Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before it is accepted to proceed to euthanasia. </seg>
<seg id="194"> Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without anything being done to ease her suffering. </seg>
<seg id="195"> I'm afraid that patients ask to die because they don't receive adequate care. </seg>
<seg id="196"> And at the same time, some oncologists work relentlessly on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses. </seg>
<seg id="197"> Hélène Richard's survival hopes were already minimal when she ended her gruelling chemotherapy. </seg>
<seg id="198"> When I announced to my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she told me she regretted that I had given up fighting, she said. </seg>
<seg id="199"> However, she had told me I was finished! </seg>
<seg id="200"> No all-powerful care </seg>
<seg id="201"> Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients asking to die thank care-givers for not having acceded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team. </seg>
<seg id="202"> But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain. </seg>
<seg id="203"> According to Elsie Monereau, Palliative Care Director with the Palliative Care Society in Greater Montreal, patients are resistant to treatment against pain in 8% of cases. </seg>
<seg id="204"> At the very end of life, physicians then often resort to palliative sedation, which is equivalent to putting the patient to sleep until the time of death, either sporadically or permanently. </seg>
<seg id="205"> We can no longer pretend not to understand this part of their suffering. </seg>
<seg id="206"> Increasingly, an unrelieved patient will have the option of having such palliative sedation. </seg>
<seg id="207"> Patients who are not relieved always say the same thing: "I want to die." </seg>
<seg id="208"> But this does not necessarily mean "I want you to euthanise me," it means "I want to be relieved." </seg>
<seg id="209"> This report was made possible thanks to a journalism award from the Canada health research institutes. </seg>
<seg id="210"> Widespread real estate scandals in Quebec </seg>
<seg id="211"> Day after day highway officials, building contractors, political party fund-raisers and Italian mafia specialists tell what they know of a formidable "system," combining the building industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and organised crime. </seg>
<seg id="212"> An "industry" which has cost Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially in the 1990s and 2000s. </seg>
<seg id="213"> "It is curious how the system is crumbling since we took drastic measures" says Jacques Duchesneau ironically, a Quebec politician and former Montreal Chief of Police. </seg>
<seg id="214"> It was through him that the scandal broke in 2011, in an in-depth investigation into corruption related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the liberal Prime Minister at the time, Jean Charest, had consented only reluctantly. </seg>
<seg id="215"> The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, under-the-table financing of parties and bribery of officials. </seg>
<seg id="216"> "Since the inquiry opened in 2010, he says, the Ministry of Transport alone reportedly saved a billion dollars on contracts," with certain people curbing their instincts to get a share! </seg>
<seg id="217"> The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors" he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "revealing the schemes behind the individuals." </seg>
<seg id="218"> A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011 </seg>
<seg id="219"> The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also coupled with its army of government analysts, investigators, and auditors. </seg>
<seg id="220"> Plus the "Marteau squad" policemen who, since 2009, have apparently led the Montreal "sewer cartel" to soft pedal on the inflation of contracts... </seg>
<seg id="221"> In recent weeks, it has conducted a series of searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, Mayor of a suburban town. </seg>
<seg id="222"> Next on the list is apparently Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval, third largest city in Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="223"> He is suspected of pocketing repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="224"> Others formally accused are Montreal highway engineers and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito. </seg>
<seg id="225"> The latter caused a sensation by explaining the mechanics of the public contracts "system" to the commission. </seg>
<seg id="226"> He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who in turn paid the money to Union Montréal, Mayor Gérald Tremblay's party. </seg>
<seg id="227"> Mr Zambito has handed money out freely in the 2000s, giving over 88,000 Canadian dollars (roughly 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power. </seg>
<seg id="228"> He also admitted having organised an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy-Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau. </seg>
<seg id="229"> Sewer contracts with inflated costs </seg>
<seg id="230"> In Montreal, the corruption "system" ran smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="231"> Gilles Surprenant, former public works engineer, described it in detail in front of the commission: in ten years, he received from construction companies gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes totalling 736,000 dollars, in exchange for sewer contracts of which he inflated the costs. </seg>
<seg id="232"> Other highway officials admitted having their palms greased by inflating invoices by 30 to 40%, and by false add-ons. </seg>
<seg id="233"> Then an organiser of the Mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of having deliberately closed his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money. </seg>
<seg id="234"> Following these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis. </seg>
<seg id="235"> Chantal Rouleau was one of the first women in Montreal to raise the alarm. </seg>
<seg id="236"> Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, to the East of the island, she protested in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought for 5 million dollars and resold for... 1.6 million to developers, at the height of the real estate boom. </seg>
<seg id="237"> 70% dirty money in election campaigns </seg>
<seg id="238"> On the investigation which will eventually be implemented, she says she "is following a thread in order to find out how the system - infiltrated by ants - works, to put a stop to the gangrene and catch the culprits." </seg>
<seg id="239"> The process, she says, is "painful but positive." </seg>
<seg id="240"> The wound is being cleaned, but Montreal would need its own investigative unit with ongoing monitoring, to avoid the return of these questionable practices. </seg>
<seg id="241"> How to clean house. </seg>
<seg id="242"> Properly. </seg>
<seg id="243"> Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is especially concerned about the role of "elected people aware of the scheme," when they were not up to their necks in the scam! </seg>
<seg id="244"> Estimating the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec at 70%, he says dryly: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality." </seg>
<seg id="245"> The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars, but this will not change the situation, he says: "Until election expenses are strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics." </seg>
<seg id="246"> He advocates a complete overhaul of the system for granting public contracts and party funding: "We can't go any lower; getting to the bottom of things, with courage, will help to rebuild the house on more solid foundations, with more controls and laws." </seg>
<seg id="247"> Although this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Duchesneau invites anyone laughing to look in their own backyard... </seg>
<seg id="248"> "PSG is not FC Barcelona!" </seg>
<seg id="249"> This season, you have taken on a new stature with PSG. </seg>
<seg id="250"> How do you explain this progression? </seg>
<seg id="251"> It can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PSG. </seg>
<seg id="252"> Some great players have arrived. </seg>
<seg id="253"> Every day I'm making progress alongside them. </seg>
<seg id="254"> The technical staff has also brought me a lot. </seg>
<seg id="255"> Day by day, all these things help me raise my level of play. </seg>
<seg id="256"> And, in a match, it's easier. </seg>
<seg id="257"> Everything moves very fast in football. </seg>
<seg id="258"> But I don't get worked up. </seg>
<seg id="259"> From my debut at the Clairefontaine INF pre-training centre to my transfer to Saint-Etienne, I've always moved step by step. </seg>
<seg id="260"> So you benefit from the competition brought in by Carlo Ancelotti... </seg>
<seg id="261"> This summer's recruits are used to playing matches at a high level. </seg>
<seg id="262"> They also know that every training session is crucial. </seg>
<seg id="263"> Which is what makes a player like me want to face up and give my best. </seg>
<seg id="264"> On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot as regards my position. </seg>
<seg id="265"> He's supported by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. </seg>
<seg id="266"> Is Ancelotti the man for the job? </seg>
<seg id="267"> Definitely. </seg>
<seg id="268"> Ancelotti inspires respect among all the experts. </seg>
<seg id="269"> Today he has no equal in Ligue 1, and he's one of the best coaches in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="270"> He has masses of experience and has won many titles with top clubs. </seg>
<seg id="271"> He's worked with great players. </seg>
<seg id="272"> I think he will bring more titles to Paris. </seg>
<seg id="273"> In January, I had an encouraging discussion with him. </seg>
<seg id="274"> I was just coming back from a series of injuries. </seg>
<seg id="275"> The confidence he gives me also explains my performance. </seg>
<seg id="276"> What importance do you attach to the first part of the season for PSG? </seg>
<seg id="277"> In Ligue 1, Lyon overtook us at the top. </seg>
<seg id="278"> But we're waiting on the sidelines. </seg>
<seg id="279"> One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the last 16 in the right way. </seg>
<seg id="280"> What is the club's goal in this competition? </seg>
<seg id="281"> We'll try to go as far as possible. </seg>
<seg id="282"> From now on, anything can happen. </seg>
<seg id="283"> But we'll have something to say against some very good European teams. </seg>
<seg id="284"> First of all, we want to finish top in our pool, ahead of Porto, to have home advantage in the last 16 match. </seg>
<seg id="285"> Can PSG become a top European club in the short term? </seg>
<seg id="286"> It already has the budget... </seg>
<seg id="287"> To become a top European club, Paris needs to win titles and keep it up over time. </seg>
<seg id="288"> Today, this isn't the case. </seg>
<seg id="289"> Financially, PSG has the means to make it happen. </seg>
<seg id="290"> In Ligue 1, would not winning the title, like last season, be a big failure? </seg>
<seg id="291"> Definitely, it would be a major disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="292"> This year, we're really committed to winning the championship. </seg>
<seg id="293"> We weren't far away last season. </seg>
<seg id="294"> In May, there was great disappointment because we were good enough to finish first. </seg>
<seg id="295"> It was a terrific season. </seg>
<seg id="296"> We finished with 79 points. </seg>
<seg id="297"> Normally, 79 points is good enough to be top... </seg>
<seg id="298"> But another team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season. </seg>
<seg id="299"> I think this is the year. </seg>
<seg id="300"> Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are competing for the title, I think we have the weapons to win. </seg>
<seg id="301"> Do you think the media expect too much of PSG? </seg>
<seg id="302"> It's normal for them to expect a lot from us given what's been invested and the players we have. </seg>
<seg id="303"> We totally accept it. </seg>
<seg id="304"> After we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and they still found things to blame us for, that's definitely a bit frustrating. </seg>
<seg id="305"> You wonder what more people expect. </seg>
<seg id="306"> You're never going to win 4-0 every weekend. </seg>
<seg id="307"> We're not FC Barcelona! </seg>
<seg id="308"> We're trying to implement a game project. </seg>
<seg id="309"> It takes time to build a team. </seg>
<seg id="310"> The Champions League proved we could hold our own. </seg>
<seg id="311"> Look at Manchester City who, for two seasons, have failed to qualify for the last 16, despite also having spent huge amounts! </seg>
<seg id="312"> Based on the amounts invested, you should be 15 points ahead at the winter break! </seg>
<seg id="313"> That would be to ignore our opponents and the French Championship. </seg>
<seg id="314"> Lyon and Marseille, who were no good last season, were "boosted" by the new PSG. </seg>
<seg id="315"> This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting. </seg>
<seg id="316"> I hope that in May we will be able to smile in saying that, despite all the difficulties, we finally did it. </seg>
<seg id="317"> PSG seem totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. </seg>
<seg id="318"> So much so that people say there is a "Zlatan dependence." </seg>
<seg id="319"> This means Ibrahimovic is very successful and scores a lot of goals. </seg>
<seg id="320"> That's why he came, and he's proving he's the star of Ligue 1. </seg>
<seg id="321"> He's demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star. </seg>
<seg id="322"> Within the group, we respect the man and the player. </seg>
<seg id="323"> And also he respects the men he has around him. </seg>
<seg id="324"> What he has done is truly exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="325"> It pushes others to raise their level of play. </seg>
<seg id="326"> Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also helps everyone else progress. </seg>
<seg id="327"> How did you get on in Euro 2012 with the France team? </seg>
<seg id="328"> A disappointment. </seg>
<seg id="329"> I really wanted to play in this Euro. </seg>
<seg id="330"> Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from getting any game time. </seg>
<seg id="331"> I saw some things there and came out stronger. </seg>
<seg id="332"> Today, I'm playing well in selection matches. </seg>
<seg id="333"> Which is what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues. </seg>
<seg id="334"> I've learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine and I now owe it to myself to have exemplary behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="335"> What do think about Didier Deschamps's first few months in charge of the Blues? </seg>
<seg id="336"> He has the results he wanted. </seg>
<seg id="337"> We're well placed in the World qualifying group. </seg>
<seg id="338"> The coach is tough, close to the players, and inspires them to win. </seg>
<seg id="339"> Like Laurent Blanc was. </seg>
<seg id="340"> But I don't want to make any comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="341"> Blanc had achieved his goal when we qualified for the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="342"> I hope Didier Deschamps will take the Blues to Brazil. </seg>
<seg id="343"> Did the good draw (1-1) snatched in Spain, on 16 October, represent a founding match? </seg>
<seg id="344"> That match gave us confidence. </seg>
<seg id="345"> Everybody fought for everybody. </seg>
<seg id="346"> Before that shock in Spain, I'd never experienced such a match in my career. </seg>
<seg id="347"> With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks </seg>
<seg id="348"> The opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees among the parties involved. </seg>
<seg id="349"> In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises. </seg>
<seg id="350"> In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file exchange. </seg>
<seg id="351"> Around 200,000 transactions have already been recorded via 15,000 computers on the network. </seg>
<seg id="352"> Close to a thousand web sites accept bitcoins as donations or means of payment. </seg>
<seg id="353"> The bitcoin exchange rate, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, returning today to around a dozen dollars (rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com site). </seg>
<seg id="354"> Nothing very impressive, compared to global transactions in real currency or financial products. </seg>
<seg id="355"> However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October. </seg>
<seg id="356"> It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency," "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies." </seg>
<seg id="357"> Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as 'credits', used to progress in a video game which you win by playing or which you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return). </seg>
<seg id="358"> The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system. </seg>
<seg id="359"> But, on each occasion, a central authority controls and handles the exchanges. </seg>
<seg id="360"> With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both custodians of the book of accounts, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers. </seg>
<seg id="361"> How does the network operate? </seg>
<seg id="362"> Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an e-mail. </seg>
<seg id="363"> Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity. </seg>
<seg id="364"> A set of information associated with this transaction is signed electronically by a dual-key encryption system. </seg>
<seg id="365"> So the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. </seg>
<seg id="366"> Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of accounts, broadcast across the entire network. </seg>
<seg id="367"> The key step is entering the new transaction in the book. </seg>
<seg id="368"> It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge issued to the computers, and the winner, a kind of interim central banker, will have the privilege of adding this extra line. </seg>
<seg id="369"> This is a file hashing phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital imprint. </seg>
<seg id="370"> Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it, then "hash" it all up. </seg>
<seg id="371"> The goal being to find the number that gives a special imprint (lots of zeros at the beginning). </seg>
<seg id="372"> Once this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check that it is the right one. </seg>
<seg id="373"> The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all the other transactions; any modification would alter the imprint. </seg>
<seg id="374"> If a user wanted to defraud by paying twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other would remain an orphan because the two have different imprints. </seg>
<seg id="375"> The computer that resolves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins. </seg>
<seg id="376"> To avoid inflation, this award is regularly divided by two, probably by the end of 2012. </seg>
<seg id="377"> The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible down to the hundred millionth, which leaves some margin... </seg>
<seg id="378"> The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in computing power. </seg>
<seg id="379"> The life of the network has had its ups and downs. </seg>
<seg id="380"> Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposits stolen. </seg>
<seg id="381"> "The loophole used is not the protocol itself" says Pierre Noizat reassuringly, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network. </seg>
<seg id="382"> The ECB also highlights the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service. </seg>
<seg id="383"> But cash also has this weakness. </seg>
<seg id="384"> Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature. </seg>
<seg id="385"> Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them. </seg>
<seg id="386"> Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analysed the accounting books and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate. </seg>
<seg id="387"> In November, "huge sell-offs" were launched. </seg>
<seg id="388"> "Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged" welcomes Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins to gold. </seg>
<seg id="389"> Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network. </seg>
<seg id="390"> His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a contactless payment by mobile, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus cheaper. </seg>
<seg id="391"> Also the user manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous. </seg>
<seg id="392"> The system is easy to implement by merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software. </seg>
<seg id="393"> They just need to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognise" says Pierre Noizat, who confirms he has thousands of users. </seg>
<seg id="394"> There is a general movement to reappraise hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems. </seg>
<seg id="395"> "It will take time for Bitcoin to become firmly established, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts. </seg>
<seg id="396"> The ECB, in its report, says it will reassess the various risks, currently regarded as high, in the event of the currency's success. </seg>
<seg id="397"> We got out of Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="398"> What now? </seg>
<seg id="399"> French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). </seg>
<seg id="400"> NATO and the Americans are due to follow in late 2014. </seg>
<seg id="401"> It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and the Afghan people to choose their future, without expecting us to do everything. </seg>
<seg id="402"> It is mainly Afghan peasants that we have punished by regarding them as terrorists. </seg>
<seg id="403"> And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded, the maimed. </seg>
<seg id="404"> The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists, former leaders in refuge in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign armed forces, like in the time of the Soviets. </seg>
<seg id="405"> They want to defend their traditions, both ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by Jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks. </seg>
<seg id="406"> Tolerated, sometimes assisted, by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be so when Westerners become more scarce. </seg>
<seg id="407"> The departure of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of hills of almond trees planted with French funding, was carried out in an orderly fashion. </seg>
<seg id="408"> Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, overflown by helicopters. </seg>
<seg id="409"> There will be no wave of the Taliban in Kabul by the end of 2014. </seg>
<seg id="410"> Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996. </seg>
<seg id="411"> At that time Kabul was empty, the country being torn apart by the struggles between different factions. </seg>
<seg id="412"> Their takeover of the country had been perceived then as a sort of liberation, a return to safety. </seg>
<seg id="413"> Afghanis paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants by the organisation of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today. </seg>
<seg id="414"> Former Mujahidin, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are allied in the desire to keep women in an inferior position. </seg>
<seg id="415"> The main anti-Soviet war leaders returned to power in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="416"> They became profiteers, seizing government land to resell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge American outsourcing contracts. </seg>
<seg id="417"> They have become discredited; what is more, most of them did not fight themselves. </seg>
<seg id="418"> The people, as I heard in the countryside, want a Government that is not made up of thieves. </seg>
<seg id="419"> Many young people want to leave, as those who were able to benefit from American largesse will leave: the flight of capital is considerable. </seg>
<seg id="420"> The young people are tired of war and its ideologies. </seg>
<seg id="421"> They have rubbed shoulders with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated the benefits. </seg>
<seg id="422"> Roughly 65% of the population is less than 25; Kabul now has 5 million people, a fifth of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="423"> In towns and cities, the state schools are full, with girls and boys alike. </seg>
<seg id="424"> It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders. </seg>
<seg id="425"> All of them, including the armed opponents, are partial to mobile phones; television, with its Turkish soap operas that show a modern world, is followed everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="426"> The army is now present. </seg>
<seg id="427"> Will the authorities who command it be considered legitimate? </seg>
<seg id="428"> Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already thinking about restoring provincial militias, which will escape the central power. </seg>
<seg id="429"> Afghanistan, land of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralisation, in the image of the Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralised State, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister, which had existed since the 1964 Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="430"> President Karzai does not want any foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of the elections in April 2014. </seg>
<seg id="431"> But, since the 50s and already well before, his country has been dependent on foreign aid. </seg>
<seg id="432"> No industries have been re-established, no dams are in good condition, no major irrigation systems have been repaired. </seg>
<seg id="433"> Everything is imported; nothing is produced, apart from fruit and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="434"> The Priority is left to private initiative. </seg>
<seg id="435"> In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary. </seg>
<seg id="436"> The rumour was spread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth. </seg>
<seg id="437"> This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to seize it. </seg>
<seg id="438"> With no energy to process the iron ore or copper on site, or means of transport to export it across the mountains, there is no mining. </seg>
<seg id="439"> The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province. </seg>
<seg id="440"> One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports largely depend, to restore normal relations. </seg>
<seg id="441"> The departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="442"> The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' high school, boys' high school, French Department at the University, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the archaeological Delegation. </seg>
<seg id="443"> Since 2009, to try to "win hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions, a "civil-military actions" service from the Ministry of defence (Cimic), closed in 2012, has carried out, and continues to carry out successfully, through a small French NGO, many community and agricultural rehabilitation projects in dozens of mountain villages. </seg>
<seg id="444"> These projects, involving large numbers of local labour, have helped to contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in cultivable areas. </seg>
<seg id="445"> What will we leave as a souvenir, after two billion euros of military spending? </seg>
<seg id="446"> A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often located over 2,000 metres above sea level. </seg>
<seg id="447"> The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from local communities in Kapisa province. </seg>
<seg id="448"> To be in a position to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups, which is what farmers told me they want, a small amount of civil aid should be maintained in their favour, well controlled and directly affecting them. </seg>
<seg id="449"> A Constitution by force in Egypt </seg>
<seg id="450"> A new gamble for President Mohammed Morsi. </seg>
<seg id="451"> While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants him full powers, he has decided to go for broke. </seg>
<seg id="452"> Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day. </seg>
<seg id="453"> Just a week ago, the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work. </seg>
<seg id="454"> For two years Egypt has relied on a provisional text, amended several times and this has weakened institutional stability and led to legal imbroglios. </seg>
<seg id="455"> This new initiative has only served to enhance the divide in the country. </seg>
<seg id="456"> According to his opponents, the President is persevering in his "autocratic delirium," continuing to "go back on his word" and 'trample the law." </seg>
<seg id="457"> His supporters affirm that this is the quickest way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis, by speeding up the transition process. </seg>
<seg id="458"> A referendum is due to be held within the next two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="459"> A very short period, which forces the Brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians. </seg>
<seg id="460"> For the President, it is also a way to achieve popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute rages throughout the country. </seg>
<seg id="461"> Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote favourably, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time. </seg>
<seg id="462"> Particularly since a hasty vote smacks of an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I keep full powers," these powers supposedly expiring following adoption of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="463"> It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted on the text yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="464"> Most of the liberals were missing. </seg>
<seg id="465"> In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, feeling they had failed to assert their views. </seg>
<seg id="466"> Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done likewise. </seg>
<seg id="467"> In order to obtain a quorum, 11 members, alternates, were hastily added yesterday morning. </seg>
<seg id="468"> Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="469"> Not surprisingly, the articles were for the most part voted unanimously. </seg>
<seg id="470"> Commentators were also amused that one of the only diversions of the day was expressed with regard to... the hour of prayer, some Committee members feeling that the Constituent Assembly clock was wrong. </seg>
<seg id="471"> The text, which was still being voted on yesterday evening, has 234 articles. </seg>
<seg id="472"> The main focus of attention, article 2, remains in the final analysis identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law." </seg>
<seg id="473"> The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, were hoping to replace "the principles" by "the rules," which would have allowed stricter application. </seg>
<seg id="474"> For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other elements of Egyptian society. </seg>
<seg id="475"> "Hypocrisy" respond the liberals, who see only a communication coup. </seg>
<seg id="476"> Because in their opinion Islamisation of the Constitution is done through other articles. </seg>
<seg id="477"> They refer in particular to article 220, which grants Al-Azhar University an advisory role, with particular reference to verifying the conformity of the laws with sharia. </seg>
<seg id="478"> According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called upon to advise are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy. </seg>
<seg id="479"> This suggests the beginnings of a theocracy." </seg>
<seg id="480"> The liberals' fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next Rector of the university will probably be much less moderate than the current one. </seg>
<seg id="481"> "For the time being, there is no concrete religious implication. </seg>
<seg id="482"> With this Constitution, things remain under civil rule. </seg>
<seg id="483"> Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Islamic law scholars but academics, some trained in the French system" qualifies Alexis Blouet, who is writing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition. </seg>
<seg id="484"> But he acknowledges that "there may be some ambiguity regarding article 220, because the terms used borrow from the religious vocabulary. </seg>
<seg id="485"> Reference is made in particular to "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, Editor's note]. </seg>
<seg id="486"> And the question could be asked in future to what extent civil judges are competent to pronounce on it." </seg>
<seg id="487"> Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="488"> The Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime. </seg>
<seg id="489"> Another issue: the powers conferred on the army. </seg>
<seg id="490"> In accordance with the wishes of the military, the Defence budget review will be not submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council. </seg>
<seg id="491"> Nor will trials of civilians will be banned in military tribunals, as requested by associations for the defence of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="492"> Who also voice their concerns about the text, which they consider repressive. </seg>
<seg id="493"> The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, particularly for the press. </seg>
<seg id="494"> In addition, no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women, highlights Heba Morayef, from Human Rights Watch. </seg>
<seg id="495"> In her opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36. </seg>
<seg id="496"> The word was not included in the previous Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="497"> While the Egyptian President was speaking yesterday evening on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="498"> Supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday. </seg>
<seg id="499"> In Israel, holy places await Ukrainian tourists, the omphalos and a sea of saline water </seg>
<seg id="500"> The Holy Land combines the splendour of biblical truths, modern comfort and primeval nature. </seg>
<seg id="501"> AiF [Argumenti i Fakti] newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to visit Israel. </seg>
<seg id="502"> Let's worship the holy places </seg>
<seg id="503"> It is worth visiting the River Jordan where Jesus was baptized. </seg>
<seg id="504"> It is considered that all who enter this baptism "bath" are blessed by God. </seg>
<seg id="505"> Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his magic: turned water into wine at a wedding, walked on water, calmed a storm, and filled the nets. </seg>
<seg id="506"> This is also where Jesus came before his disciples and after the resurrection. </seg>
<seg id="507"> But the biggest number of holy places is in Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="508"> Believers walk through the Way of Grief or Via Dolorosa. </seg>
<seg id="509"> It starts by the Antonia Fortress - Praetorium - where the judgement took place, and brings us along the streets of the Old Town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha - the place of the crucifixion, Stone of Unction and the place of Jesus' burial. </seg>
<seg id="510"> This is also the location of the symbolic Christian omphalos, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind. </seg>
<seg id="511"> The Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem is erected at the site that, according to Christian legend, yielded the tree used to make the cross for Jesus' crucifixion. </seg>
<seg id="512"> Jerusalem has the most holy places for the Jews as well - the Wailing Wall, which remained from a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD. </seg>
<seg id="513"> According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes here with their wishes, which are then fulfilled. </seg>
<seg id="514"> Travel along a vertical </seg>
<seg id="515"> Ruins of the Massada Fortress remain from a secret refuge from enemies, built by Herod in 25 BC for his family. </seg>
<seg id="516"> They are located on cliffs in the mountains at an elevation of 450 m above sea level. </seg>
<seg id="517"> They can be reached on foot only by those who are into mountain climbing. </seg>
<seg id="518"> Others are delivered to this historical mountaintop by a cableway. </seg>
<seg id="519"> In the north of the country, at an elevation of 1600-2040 m, there is a famous ski resort called Hermon, which fills up with tourists in winter months. </seg>
<seg id="520"> A shuttle bus brings people to it from the foot of the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="521"> The total length of ski pistes is 45 km. </seg>
<seg id="522"> According to an ancient legend, pagan gods used to live on the mountain. </seg>
<seg id="523"> Visit unique museums </seg>
<seg id="524"> This country has about 300 museums. </seg>
<seg id="525"> You won't be able to visit all of them on one trip </seg>
<seg id="526"> But at least the five most interesting ones are worth a visit. </seg>
<seg id="527"> Among them - Museum of Israel, located close to Knesset (Parliament). </seg>
<seg id="528"> It has ancient Qumran manuscripts and Dead Sea scrolls found in the caves of the Judean desert, along with about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological artefacts. </seg>
<seg id="529"> The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also interesting. </seg>
<seg id="530"> Its exhibits include a wide range of impressionists and expressionists like Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Sisley, Cezanne, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso. </seg>
<seg id="531"> In Akko, you can visit the bath museum Al-Basha, which consists of several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bath attendants of the time. </seg>
<seg id="532"> In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can enjoy the sculptures of Dali and Rodin. </seg>
<seg id="533"> There are no tour guides or gift shops. </seg>
<seg id="534"> Entry is free of charge, and contributions are strictly not allowed. </seg>
<seg id="535"> The fifth one is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel-Aviv, which tells one of the most dramatic stories in history. </seg>
<seg id="536"> The most tragic section is the children's memorial, built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers. </seg>
<seg id="537"> You go in and find yourself in complete darkness. </seg>
<seg id="538"> Stars are glimmering, </seg>
<seg id="539"> and you listen to names of Jewish children and countries where they died. </seg>
<seg id="540"> Ukraine is mentioned there too. </seg>
<seg id="541"> Wellness </seg>
<seg id="542"> There are three resort areas in Israel, located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red, and Dead Seas. </seg>
<seg id="543"> Each have swimming pools, aqua parks, dolphinaria and oceanaria. </seg>
<seg id="544"> It is notable that one can swim in the Red Sea even in winter months, because the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air warms to 23 degrees. </seg>
<seg id="545"> The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people swim in it all year round. </seg>
<seg id="546"> Incidentally, it is the most unusual sea in the world, located in the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below sea level. </seg>
<seg id="547"> Its azure water is saline and easily keeps you afloat, even if you don't know how to swim. </seg>
<seg id="548"> The surrounding landscapes are surreal in their beauty. </seg>
<seg id="549"> People come here to undergo a course of treatment using salt water - wraps and medicinal muds, and to improve their health if they have dermatitis, allergies, asthmas, eczemas, arthritis, bronchitis, or diabetes, or to return emotional balance. </seg>
<seg id="550"> Touch the mysteries of antiquity </seg>
<seg id="551"> They are preserved in the old section of Tel-Aviv - in the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean Sea. </seg>
<seg id="552"> The famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia runs through it. </seg>
<seg id="553"> The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends. </seg>
<seg id="554"> According to legends, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beauty Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life. </seg>
<seg id="555"> Tourists really like to wander the narrow streets named after signs of the zodiac. </seg>
<seg id="556"> They say, if you touch the walls on the street of your sign, fortune will come to you. </seg>
<seg id="557"> In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries for photo sessions. </seg>
<seg id="558"> And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can walk around a Roman theatre, "capture" the Crusader fortress. </seg>
<seg id="559"> During the Roman period, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prefects, including Pontius Pilate. </seg>
<seg id="560"> The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances. </seg>
<seg id="561"> A note for the tourist </seg>
<seg id="562"> When you go to Israel, don't worry about your bad English knowledge: approximately 30% of the country's population speaks Russian. </seg>
<seg id="563"> For the trip, it is better to take dollars, not euros, because they are easily exchanged for shekels (currently 1 dollar = 3.8 shekels). </seg>
<seg id="564"> City transportation is mainly buses, but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram, and Haifa has the only subway line in the country, comprising six stops and connecting upper town with lower. </seg>
<seg id="565"> In essence, it is an underground cable railway. </seg>
<seg id="566"> A ticket for any type of city transportation costs 6 shekels, and you can ride for 1.5 hours with transfers. </seg>
<seg id="567"> According to the Jewish tradition, Sabbath is celebrated in Israel. </seg>
<seg id="568"> Between Friday evening and the sunset on Saturday, markets, stores, and public transportation stop working. </seg>
<seg id="569"> The work week starts on Sunday morning. </seg>
<seg id="570"> Many cafes, restaurants and hotels have only kosher food, with no pork, seafood, fish with no scales, or dishes that combine milk with meat. </seg>
<seg id="571"> There is a wide selection of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts cooked using coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus paste, various sauces, falafel (balls made of ground chickpeas), fruits and vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="572"> The streets of Israel don't have homeless dogs. </seg>
<seg id="573"> But there are many well-fed cats, which walk around lazily. </seg>
<seg id="574"> In the evening, they can even be seen sleeping on roofs of parked cars. </seg>
<seg id="575"> These pussycats like busy places and do not refuse treats. </seg>
<seg id="576"> Car rental, depending on car type, costs from 37 (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) dollars a day. </seg>
<seg id="577"> Plus insurance of 15 dollars a day. </seg>
<seg id="578"> Bike rental costs 15 shekels a day. </seg>
<seg id="579"> Museum entrance costs 30 shekels on average. </seg>
<seg id="580"> In numbers </seg>
<seg id="581"> In 2012, over three million tourists from around the world visited Israel. </seg>
<seg id="582"> Visitors and holidaymakers arrive mostly from the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="583"> Between January and October 2012 118,800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Holy Land, which is 51% more than a similar figure in 2010, before the removal of the visa regime on February 9, 2011. </seg>
<seg id="584"> Only the "high and mighty" make it to Moscow: migrants save money for language </seg>
<seg id="585"> While deputies and human rights activists argue about the purpose of the law on mandatory language testing, the country already has scam artists who sell fake certificates. </seg>
<seg id="586"> Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="587"> Mostly these are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. </seg>
<seg id="588"> Their only goal is to earn money to support families back home. </seg>
<seg id="589"> A new law came into effect on December 1, which obliges every migrant worker to pass a Russian language test. </seg>
<seg id="590"> For the moment, this law applies only to those who intend to work in services, housing and utility services, household services, and retail. </seg>
<seg id="591"> But with time - as promised by the Federal Migration Service - tests will become mandatory for all non-residents. </seg>
<seg id="592"> In addition to language, Russian history and basics of the legal system will be tested. </seg>
<seg id="593"> Language knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive and to extend the work permit. </seg>
<seg id="594"> An exception is in effect only for citizens of countries where Russian is a state language. </seg>
<seg id="595"> People who received education certificates and diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also exempt under the law. </seg>
<seg id="596"> Purpose, doomed fate, and the protection of rights </seg>
<seg id="597"> Seven testing points will be operating under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, Peoples' Friendship University of Russia, Moscow State University (MGU), St. Petersburg State University (SPbGU), and other Russian education institutions. </seg>
<seg id="598"> Migrants can take the tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres have been opened. </seg>
<seg id="599"> The initiative to introduce the testing was supported by State Duma members and the Federal Migration Services. </seg>
<seg id="600"> But human rights activists, asked the question repeatedly in the press before the law came into force: what will it actually achieve? </seg>
<seg id="601"> What will the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and for the non-residents? </seg>
<seg id="602"> First of all, according to representatives of the migration service, this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from labour slavery. </seg>
<seg id="603"> Many speak about protection of the rights of work migrants, explains the Head of the representative office of the Federal Migration Services of Russia, Viktor Sebelev. </seg>
<seg id="604"> Rights protection should begin before their departure. </seg>
<seg id="605"> Only the system of organized selection will enable us to solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="606"> Migrants without profession, education, who do not know Russian, who do not have a medical certificate start to have problems. </seg>
<seg id="607"> If a migrant does not understand the language, says Sebelev with certainty, he is doomed to come across unconscientious people, who, pretending to help, will force upon him a "ticket" to terrible, cramped barracks where many others like him will suffer without food and documents, slaving away 12-14 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id="608"> We receive many complaints from our migrants. </seg>
<seg id="609"> "They are promised one thing at home, but when they arrive, they are lied to, their passports are taken, they are not paid what they were promised," confirms the Head of the Main Migrant Labour Administration of the Migration Service of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov. </seg>
<seg id="610"> Not be angry, boss! </seg>
<seg id="611"> Nonetheless, many citizens of Central Asian countries, who plan to go to work in Russia, admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good, but they can barely write in their own language. </seg>
<seg id="612"> Naturally, this is not so much their fault, but due to poverty: very few Turks, Uzbeks, and Tajiks can afford even a basic education. </seg>
<seg id="613"> Their families don't even have food to feed their children, not to mention decent clothing, shoes, and supplies. </seg>
<seg id="614"> After reaching adolescence, these kids go to work at the first opportunity. </seg>
<seg id="615"> It is hard, if language knowledge is bad, they admit. </seg>
<seg id="616"> "You feel humiliated and inferior." </seg>
<seg id="617"> But human rights activists note one important point about the law on language. </seg>
<seg id="618"> Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status. </seg>
<seg id="619"> If they have no status, there will be no testing, nor any official work in the future. </seg>
<seg id="620"> In the meantime, most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally. </seg>
<seg id="621"> "Welcome, or No Unauthorized Entry" </seg>
<seg id="622"> Many of the foreigners assert that receiving official status in our country is not that easy. </seg>
<seg id="623"> The reason lies in bureaucratic hurdles and the already mentioned language difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="624"> In addition, legalization costs money: from 12,000 to 16,000 rubles. </seg>
<seg id="625"> Whereas a fake registration is done quickly and costs only one and a half thousand. </seg>
<seg id="626"> Officers of the Russian Police know that we mainly have fake papers, without registration, hence the extortion. </seg>
<seg id="627"> "They ask for a hundred or two for cigarettes, tea," Umed Khushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, shared with journalists. </seg>
<seg id="628"> "Roll up, don't be cheap, get your artwork" </seg>
<seg id="629"> On the first day of the law's entry into effect it turned out that not only migrant registration documents can be fake. </seg>
<seg id="630"> A few forged certificates about passing language tests have been seized by Federal Migration Services officers already. </seg>
<seg id="631"> Forged documents are printed on a standard colour printer. </seg>
<seg id="632"> Naturally, they were not free for their owners: each of the migrants, who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand rubles for them. </seg>
<seg id="633"> It is two and a half times more than the process of official testing, which costs three thousand. </seg>
<seg id="634"> Government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates could not just be bought. </seg>
<seg id="635"> For the moment, the authorities can promise migrant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course. </seg>
<seg id="636"> In addition, those who come without Russian language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people. </seg>
<seg id="637"> The Ministry of the Interior does not put arms from the illegal market back into circulation </seg>
<seg id="638"> The share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low </seg>
<seg id="639"> The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to toughen up the law for owners of civil weapons. </seg>
<seg id="640"> This is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents: CLICK shots at weddings, where there were no casualties, and the massacre staged by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, resulting in CLICK the death of seven people. </seg>
<seg id="641"> Policemen want to prohibit the carrying of weapons in public places and raise the legal age of weapons licensing from 18 to 21. </seg>
<seg id="642"> The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Safety and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="643"> Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by "tightening the screws." </seg>
<seg id="644"> An open letter appeared online, whose authors - representatives of different social rifle organizations - demand to abandon the "senseless toughening." </seg>
<seg id="645"> The percentage of crime involving registered weapons is minimal, said criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov to BBC Russia. </seg>
<seg id="646"> According to the Ministry of the Interior's statistics, 142 crimes using firearms registered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012, whereas 1,168,000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period. </seg>
<seg id="647"> Authors of the open letter are certain that the toughening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the "black" market. </seg>
<seg id="648"> According to them, one can find any weapon at a low price right now. </seg>
<seg id="649"> Nonetheless, the Ministry of the Interior asserts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control. </seg>
<seg id="650"> Suppliers: from plants to officers </seg>
<seg id="651"> The "black" market of weapons is replenished through several channels. </seg>
<seg id="652"> There are five such channels, explains retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="653"> Screenshot of the site that accepts orders for weapons. </seg>
<seg id="654"> First: "army or military loot," i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus. </seg>
<seg id="655"> "Weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Caucasians," says Baranets. </seg>
<seg id="656"> Next are "black weapons," stolen by criminals from representatives of defence agencies. </seg>
<seg id="657"> Baranets explains that this covers weapons taken from police warehouses and those stolen directly from law enforcement agencies' employees. </seg>
<seg id="658"> Illegal arms are taken to be sold from military warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="659"> Explosions have often been heard at military warehouses. </seg>
<seg id="660"> "There are proven theories that some of the fires were intentional, in order to cover the shortage," says the former military man. </seg>
<seg id="661"> Manufacturers of weapons make their contribution, according to Baranets. </seg>
<seg id="662"> "There are so many private weapons factories now, which do not endure competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market, including in Moscow," says the expert. </seg>
<seg id="663"> Another source of the "black" market is trafficking. </seg>
<seg id="664"> An especially high number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan. </seg>
<seg id="665"> "There's production there, sometimes handmade; and a mafia has formed, which has organized a stream," explains the former military man. </seg>
<seg id="666"> Where do the weapons come from? </seg>
<seg id="667"> Experts counted the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market. </seg>
<seg id="668"> A report about this was prepared by the Centre of Problems Analysis and Public Management Planning in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="669"> Experts analysed the reports of the Department of the Interior and Rosstat, criminology literature and open data from portals on weapons. </seg>
<seg id="670"> The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons, according to the researchers, comes from the military and security forces. </seg>
<seg id="671"> Half of all arms on the black market are there "because of officials, whose work is connected with weapons," states the report. </seg>
<seg id="672"> According to researchers' data, 17% of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas, 14% is theft during production, 5% is "black archaeology." </seg>
<seg id="673"> A sales consultant of one of the weapons stores, who wished to remain anonymous, asserts that the weapons found by "black" diggers are not being bought any more, because they're too old. </seg>
<seg id="674"> According to him, dealers go to the military warehouse for a new batch of goods. </seg>
<seg id="675"> One piece, for example a TT gun can be bought from a warrant officer. </seg>
<seg id="676"> It is issued to him, and given through the fence. </seg>
<seg id="677"> "He takes it to the city and sells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines," he says. </seg>
<seg id="678"> "The truth is that police are aware of everything, that is why periodically, when the crime detection rate is low, it conducts test purchases from illegal weapons merchants," says the consultant. </seg>
<seg id="679"> "Like in a luxury store" </seg>
<seg id="680"> The buyer and seller often find each other through friends. </seg>
<seg id="681"> I looked at sites, blogs, till someone responded, offering me to go to Begovaya station, where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the "corner" so we can negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="682"> I found out the price of the weapon only there </seg>
<seg id="683"> military commentator Viktor Baranets </seg>
<seg id="684"> To get a weapon, I need someone with connections, says the sales consultant. - I have an acquaintance, but I'm not sure it's reliable. </seg>
<seg id="685"> There are salesmen on labour markets, but one needs to "come" there conditionally "from John Doe, who asked to tell that his daughter lost a tooth." </seg>
<seg id="686"> Right now, even if I need a few knuckledusters, I get them through someone I trust. </seg>
<seg id="687"> He also supplies them only to me, because he knows that I won't give him away. </seg>
<seg id="688"> Beginners look for weapons in different ways. </seg>
<seg id="689"> Former military man Viktor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990's, when he was preparing to publish an article about this. </seg>
<seg id="690"> The formulas are still the same, according to him. </seg>
<seg id="691"> He was given an album of pictures with "anything and everything." </seg>
<seg id="692"> "I felt like I was in a luxury store," he recalls. </seg>
<seg id="693"> According to Baranets, the buyer is not offered a pig in a poke - you can try out everything. </seg>
<seg id="694"> I, the potential client, am not just buying; we go to the forest with the seller and set a target there. </seg>
<seg id="695"> "I am given the opportunity to shoot, and when I am certain that the weapon is good, we begin to negotiate," describes the expert. </seg>
<seg id="696"> Store on a sofa </seg>
<seg id="697"> Internet searches lead to sites and "Vkontakte" groups, where weapons "for different purposes" are on offer. </seg>
<seg id="698"> No documents or personal meetings are needed. </seg>
<seg id="699"> "It's enough to have a certain sum of money," says the advertisement heading on the website "Buy a pistol or rifle." </seg>
<seg id="700"> Users leave their requests and ask questions. </seg>
<seg id="701"> Can a minor buy? </seg>
<seg id="702"> "Without a license, of course," asks user "John" (name is changed). </seg>
<seg id="703"> "Want to buy a TT, Moscow," concisely requests "Fedorenkov." </seg>
<seg id="704"> Federal Security Service now spread a big network of fake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons. </seg>
<seg id="705"> People come like hungry fish to bait, and then mine coal in Siberia. </seg>
<seg id="706"> military commentator and former military man Viktor Baranets </seg>
<seg id="707"> I heard about this: normally the site is registered outside the area of applicability of the laws of Russia. </seg>
<seg id="708"> People accept orders. </seg>
<seg id="709"> The buyer pays at an ATM. </seg>
<seg id="710"> "In response, a photo is sent with instructions on where the weapon is hidden," says Press Secretary of the Rights to Weapons non-governmental organization Dmitry Kislov. </seg>

<seg id="720"> Fast-food and supermarket workers are on strike in the U.S.A. </seg>
<seg id="721"> Up to a fourth of all American teenagers have worked the cash register at McDonald's at one time or another </seg>
<seg id="722"> In the last few days, there is a wave of protest actions in the U.S.A. against low salaries in supermarkets of the Walmart chain and popular fast food chain restaurants like McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken. </seg>
<seg id="723"> Right now, nobody is able to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or it is destined to fizzle out early. </seg>
<seg id="724"> Actions are being supported by unions and a series of left-wing organizations. </seg>
<seg id="725"> In addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of Walmart and fast food chains, the goal of the protesters is to create unions within them. </seg>
<seg id="726"> This sector of the economy is not covered by any union movement yet. </seg>
<seg id="727"> 46 cents a year? </seg>
<seg id="728"> Actions began last week after Thanksgiving, on Black Friday, when massive sales drew millions of people in America, sometimes accompanied by clashes. </seg>
<seg id="729"> On this day, some employees of the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their workplaces and picketed together with the unions and left-wing activists from the corporation stores that sell products to people on low-to-medium incomes. </seg>
<seg id="730"> Walmart sells everything imaginable, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk. </seg>
<seg id="731"> Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in major supermarkets. </seg>
<seg id="732"> So many low-paid Walmart employees shop only at their workplace. </seg>
<seg id="733"> Availability and assortment made Walmart one of the biggest American corporations. </seg>
<seg id="734"> According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the products cheaply partly because it pays little to its employees. </seg>
<seg id="735"> These latter also complain about hard work conditions, for example lack of lift trucks and hand-held scanners. </seg>
<seg id="736"> Protesters on Black Friday demanded a salary increase and complained that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month. </seg>
<seg id="737"> A typical Walmart employee, receiving 9.5 dollars/hour, cannot afford this. </seg>
<seg id="738"> Scientists from the Berkeley University in California argue that if Walmart raises the average salary to 12 dollars/hour, it will cost the corporation 3.2 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="739"> This is about 1.1% more than it spends on salaries right now. </seg>
<seg id="740"> If Walmart fully shifts the cost of increasing wages to the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more. </seg>
<seg id="741"> In one year, they will only spend 12.39 dollars more than now. </seg>
<seg id="742"> Walmart supporters happily note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the corporation. </seg>
<seg id="743"> Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 in the evening on Thursday till midnight the next day, and during the period Walmart sold about 5000 products a second. </seg>
<seg id="744"> In total, its cash registers conducted nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday. </seg>
<seg id="745"> Representative of the corporation, Dan Fogelman, asserted in an interview with a left-wing site, the Huffington Post, that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees left the workplace, and the protest act was just "another PR trick" of the union that organized it. </seg>
<seg id="746"> "Free cash register!" </seg>
<seg id="747"> Protests continued this week in New York, where their object was not Walmart (they're not so welcome in the progressive city, that is why they don't exist here yet), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="748"> McDonald's says that it sells billions of portions, and despite this it doesn't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work! </seg>
<seg id="749"> Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council of New York </seg>
<seg id="750"> At the moment, the minimum salary according to federal and NY law is 7.25 dollars an hour. </seg>
<seg id="751"> Fast food restaurants increase it with time, but very little. On average their ordinary employees in New York earn 8.90 dollars/hour. </seg>
<seg id="752"> Nobody earns less in this expensive city. </seg>
<seg id="753"> I cannot understand how one can survive in New York on this money. </seg>
<seg id="754"> Once upon a time, almost a fourth of American teenagers went through McDonald's, working part-time after school, living with parents. </seg>
<seg id="755"> Few saw this as a source of living or planned to stay there for long. </seg>
<seg id="756"> Now I continuously come across interviews with McDonald's employees, who complain that they have to survive on this salary and sometimes even feed their children. </seg>
<seg id="757"> On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them. </seg>
<seg id="758"> Participants of the protest that began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday near the McDonald's on 40th street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and cooks of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars/hour, i.e. more than double their present wages. </seg>
<seg id="759"> They also demanded the creation of unions in the fast food industry. </seg>
<seg id="760"> American law prohibits the administration from preventing this or punishing activists of the union movement by nagging or firing. </seg>
<seg id="761"> On the other hand, the administration does not often ease their life. </seg>
<seg id="762"> But for objective reasons it is hard to cover fast food with a union. </seg>
<seg id="763"> One of them is the unusual turnover of employees. </seg>
<seg id="764"> Disagreeing </seg>
<seg id="765"> Noisy protests began on this day in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan. </seg>
<seg id="766"> The highlight of the action was the afternoon meeting near McDonald's by Times Square, where several local democratic politicians spoke out. One of them, Jumaane Williams, said: "McDonald's claims it sells billions of portions, and despite this it doesn't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work!" </seg>
<seg id="767"> Demonstrators were supported by other prominent NY democrats, like Bill de Blasio, a candidate for NY city mayor, who said: "We need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees, so that they can achieve fair wages and economic wellbeing, which every New Yorker deserves!." </seg>
<seg id="768"> According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry. </seg>
<seg id="769"> But only a few hundred people took part in it, and many of them were not fast food employees, which comprise tens of thousands of people in New York. </seg>
<seg id="770"> It is unclear right now whether this will spark a mass movement. </seg>
<seg id="771"> "At the moment, the mind cannot be deceived too well" </seg>
<seg id="772"> Among modern technology fans a popular topic is augmented reality, lately seen primarily through the prism of special glasses. </seg>
<seg id="773"> At first, a functional model was shown by Google in the summer, at its annual conference. Then, in November, it was announced that Microsoft filed an application for patent too. </seg>
<seg id="774"> However, according to the conversation with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft, Shahram Izadi, glasses are a thing of the past for scientists in this company. </seg>
<seg id="775"> They are drawn by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual open spaces. </seg>
<seg id="776"> - Please tell us, in simple terms, about the work your research group does. </seg>
<seg id="777"> - We work on the interaction of people with machines, at the same time trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="778"> While people in general are stuck at working with pixels on a flat screen and sometimes pointing fingers at them. </seg>
<seg id="779"> We want to look 5-10 years into the future and predict cardinal changes in this interaction. </seg>
<seg id="780"> For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward. Almost no Xbox is sold without Kinect today, because everyone likes control by gestures. </seg>
<seg id="781"> - What else awaits us in the future? </seg>
<seg id="782"> - Despite the fact that Kinect shifted the interaction to the physical level, much still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D. </seg>
<seg id="783"> Information entry has improved (the system receives more data), but output still needs to get better. </seg>
<seg id="784"> We are trying to change this, working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projection technologies. </seg>
<seg id="785"> We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible. </seg>
<seg id="786"> But for this, we need to identify both the user and the space around him. </seg>
<seg id="787"> Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form. </seg>
<seg id="788"> Above all, get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets! </seg>
<seg id="789"> - What do you think about voice control? </seg>
<seg id="790"> It's a popular thing, but is it overestimated? </seg>
<seg id="791"> - It clearly cannot be called a cure-for-all - there's a question of privacy, because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and intentions. </seg>
<seg id="792"> In reality, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in their own niche. </seg>
<seg id="793"> For example, we had a project to control devices in public places, in which we thought about movements, not wide movements, but small, reserved ones. </seg>
<seg id="794"> Movements were not recorded by a camera, but by a hand bracelet that determined the movement of bones and muscles. </seg>
<seg id="795"> It's big right now, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a hand watch. </seg>
<seg id="796"> In general, the future lies in the mixed control, e.g. movement + voice. </seg>
<seg id="797"> - What do you mean? </seg>
<seg id="798"> - For example, how would you ask me to give you this bottle of water? </seg>
<seg id="799"> You will talk and show at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="800"> - Usually I just say. </seg>
<seg id="801"> - Oh, that will be very hard to detect. </seg>
<seg id="802"> - So you want to make the users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment? </seg>
<seg id="803"> - Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approximation. </seg>
<seg id="804"> I think in the near future, we will mainly work on developing new sensors that will enable more precise determination of a person's reaction. </seg>
<seg id="805"> This could be, e.g. laser sensors. They have a decent depth resolution, which is very important. </seg>
<seg id="806"> - If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras? </seg>
<seg id="807"> Not enough resolution, depth or something else? </seg>
<seg id="808"> - In general, the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on three-dimensional recognition. </seg>
<seg id="809"> Of course, it would be good to have eight mega pixels with 1000 k/s speed. </seg>
<seg id="810"> It's not just the mega pixels, though, but the quality of the matrix and the depth. </seg>
<seg id="811"> From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorithm designers. </seg>
<seg id="812"> So it's important to remember about the resolution on the X, Y, but also the Z axis. </seg>
<seg id="813"> Speed, the number of images per second, is also very important. </seg>
<seg id="814"> Human movements are relatively dynamic, and the current 30 k/s is really not enough, especially for gestures. </seg>
<seg id="815"> Steven Bathiche from our Redmond laboratory created a touch sensor with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms, while modern serial sensors are closer to the latter indicator (60-100). </seg>
<seg id="816"> Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="817"> In my work, it would be very useful to have a device that does not require touching and would have more images per second. </seg>
<seg id="818"> - Does the number of cameras need to be increased? </seg>
<seg id="819"> - In Kinect there are three cameras now, one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the second one, the recipient of the signal. </seg>
<seg id="820"> The third one is actually a regular sensor of visible range. </seg>
<seg id="821"> It is not applied to determine the object's depth. </seg>
<seg id="822"> Potentially, a large number of cameras could solve the problem... </seg>
<seg id="823"> Or make it worse, by increasing the required volume of calculations. </seg>
<seg id="824"> It would be nice to create a flexible analogue Kinect, play with the flexion of camera disposition and see how this will help in three-dimensional determination of the position. </seg>
<seg id="825"> - As far as I remember, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public, unlike Google. </seg>
<seg id="826"> Don't you think this is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday use of augmented reality technologies? </seg>
<seg id="827"> - Certainly it is not very convenient to walk around with a smart phone in your raised hands all the time, but I think that the coolest option would be "transitional" augmented reality, where you could shift from glasses to smart phone, projection display, and everywhere else based on a cloud platform. </seg>
<seg id="828"> Glasses are a very personal device, that is their strength (private things are seen only by you) and, at the same time, their weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people. </seg>
<seg id="829"> - Let us imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Ironman, but to a regular person. </seg>
<seg id="830"> There is one problem with this idea that the critics often point out: no tactile feedback! </seg>
<seg id="831"> Hands feel nothing! </seg>
<seg id="832"> What answers does your group prepare to this challenge? </seg>
<seg id="833"> - In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive attempt at the interaction between man and machine. </seg>
<seg id="834"> I think that the eighth will probably be the addition of tactile sensations. </seg>
<seg id="835"> For now, one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a sort of matrix for the image. </seg>
<seg id="836"> It is great at registering pushes! </seg>
<seg id="837"> But there are technologies that are really aimed at giving these "images in the air" a sense of tangibility, for example, the interference of several targeted ultrasound rays in a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation, but very weak right now, as if someone blew on your fingertip. </seg>
<seg id="838"> There are also wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings in fingers, which is also a promising area. </seg>
<seg id="839"> - Have you tried to deceive the mind? </seg>
<seg id="840"> To force it to think that it feels something that it should be feeling when it sees something? </seg>
<seg id="841"> - This is a good idea and we haven't tried this yet. </seg>
<seg id="842"> It conceals one challenge that will not be solved so quickly - how to force a person, who is physically in a very limited space to believe that he is walking along an open, almost limitless space; we are working on the concept of treadmills (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms, and giant balloons. </seg>
<seg id="843"> So far deceiving the mind has had limited success, there's work for many years to come. </seg>
<seg id="844"> That's what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their very beginnings. </seg>
<seg id="845"> Judgement calls instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru </seg>
<seg id="846"> Rosbalt continues the project St. Petersburg Avant-garde, dedicated to residents who are ahead, in the avant-garde of culture and art. </seg>
<seg id="847"> This top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the scope of the city, often recognized in Europe, bypassing fame in Russia. </seg>
<seg id="848"> The new player in Rosbalt - the bold artist Kirill Miller. </seg>
<seg id="849"> The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed all in red, who can be seen by the Russian Museum, or by the Summer Garden, or at fashionable parties and shows. </seg>
<seg id="850"> Kirill Miller's work always brings in crowds of people, no matter where they are exhibited. </seg>
<seg id="851"> Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and philosophical storytellers and creators of new mythology. </seg>
<seg id="852"> Kirill Miller is an outstanding man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80's early 90's. </seg>
<seg id="853"> Moreover, he is a city man, who makes people smile on the street and lifts up everyone's spirit. </seg>
<seg id="854"> Recently he took up the street organ and became St. Petersburg's music man, because he was ready for this complex role with all his Bohemian existence, philosophy and image. </seg>
<seg id="855"> - Kirill, why do you walk around the city all in red, not yellow or turquoise, for example? </seg>
<seg id="856"> - I chose the colour red as a fashion designer engaged in look and image. </seg>
<seg id="857"> In this world, red is a compromise between artist, image-maker and society. </seg>
<seg id="858"> Although in society, everything that is not grey causes aggression and agitation of the bad kind. </seg>
<seg id="859"> But my provocations are aimed at starting conversation. </seg>
<seg id="860"> The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion. </seg>
<seg id="861"> - When did you realise that you must be an artist? </seg>
<seg id="862"> - At an exhibition in the Nevsky House of Culture, where my work was displayed. </seg>
<seg id="863"> It became clear to me that this is my path. </seg>
<seg id="864"> Then, the wave of older free, unofficial artists was gone, while new, free artists like me were not understood. </seg>
<seg id="865"> I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with post-Gaza-Nevsky style artists ("post-gazonevschina"), which led to Pushkinskaya-10, and the wave was no longer. </seg>
<seg id="866"> I'm drawn to theatre, clothing, music, all genres except for literature. </seg>
<seg id="867"> - And all this has been united in your Art-clinic... - It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should come together. </seg>
<seg id="868"> In 1995, I occupied the territory on Pushkinskaya-10, and while the renovation work had not started, there was a musical and creative club, a Bohemian club, the house of the St. Petersburg Bohemia. </seg>
<seg id="869"> Many were born there: NOMy, Tequila Jazz, I remember when Shnur was brought there with the Van Gogh's Ear project. </seg>
<seg id="870"> Shnur and his friends lip sang easy songs, wearing tight leotards, and the now trendy composer Igor Vdovin was with them. </seg>
<seg id="871"> When the group began to play live, it became Leningrad. </seg>
<seg id="872"> Trakhtenberg was the presenter of many programs before Hali-Gali times. </seg>
<seg id="873"> We gave them Trakhtenberg, and a great career was on its way, but the basic education and mentoring he received from us. </seg>
<seg id="874"> Gallery D 137, Griboyedov club - all these echo the Art-clinic. </seg>
<seg id="875"> That is where our staff and regular customers left for. </seg>
<seg id="876"> I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something. </seg>
<seg id="877"> In 2000, there was a poll in the press, for the People of Our City prize. </seg>
<seg id="878"> I was nominated Artist of the Year, my climax came to an end. </seg>
<seg id="879"> In the new times, it is uncomfortable to work by old rules. I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century. </seg>
<seg id="880"> In our time, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different. You can be popular, but not very cultural. </seg>
<seg id="881"> - Your work is marked by a recognizable style. </seg>
<seg id="882"> - Many of my works are hits, with clearly reflected relevance and acuity. </seg>
<seg id="883"> I will have a programme exhibit, "Russian museum in clowns." </seg>
<seg id="884"> Clowns are a timeless category. </seg>
<seg id="885"> I was social before, now it is painful and scary to be like that. </seg>
<seg id="886"> But everything is blurred in clowns, tragedy is removed. </seg>
<seg id="887"> I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas. </seg>
<seg id="888"> For example, saving the world by totalitarian changing of clothes by order. </seg>
<seg id="889"> Nowadays, people are judged by appearance, not their inner qualities. </seg>
<seg id="890"> Who knows, maybe you cannot shake his hand, and need to spit in his face. </seg>
<seg id="891"> And the lie will go away with the help of changing clothes. </seg>
<seg id="892"> - Recently we saw you in the role of music man. - A cultural city should have such a character. </seg>
<seg id="893"> Who fits the role better than I? </seg>
<seg id="894"> - Maybe commercial art can also be beautiful? </seg>
<seg id="895"> - Nowadays, commercial art should be neat, considerate, sweet. </seg>
<seg id="896"> There is a disintegration of cultures. </seg>
<seg id="897"> People used to get together in flocks, Bohemians liked one thing, the simple people, something else. </seg>
<seg id="898"> Now, everybody is divided into micro societies, it's hard to be liked by everyone. </seg>
<seg id="899"> I am not a hundred dollar bill to please all. </seg>
<seg id="900"> Now you have to think who you will please. </seg>
<seg id="901"> Now, each cult hero has 100 fans. </seg>
<seg id="902"> - But several thousand come to Stas Mikhailov! </seg>
<seg id="903"> - The cast-outs go to see him, the sexual-social sphere is at work there. </seg>
<seg id="904"> But 300 people will come for culture, not 10,000. In the end, there's less management, money, everything dies out. </seg>
<seg id="905"> I have fans; the main thing is not to betray them, not to spoil what I have earned. </seg>
<seg id="906"> In my youth, I painted such art that one collector had it hanging on the same wall with Falk and Larionov. </seg>
<seg id="907"> I started with paintings, which people usually end with. </seg>
<seg id="908"> Concepts are often mixed up these days. </seg>
<seg id="909"> People say: spiritual culture, consumer culture. </seg>
<seg id="910"> There is no culture in consumerism, it's "from another opera." </seg>
<seg id="911"> I am a man of yesterday's culture. I grew up on examples of artists who lived poor and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of painting. </seg>
<seg id="912"> This is the culture I'm for. </seg>
<seg id="913"> - Kirill, what is St. Petersburg missing? </seg>
<seg id="914"> - Good cultural experts. </seg>
<seg id="915"> There is such a thing: an official for culture. </seg>
<seg id="916"> But not everyone can be engaged in culture. </seg>
<seg id="917"> Under the right rulers everything was different. Kings may not have understood culture very well, but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts. </seg>
<seg id="918"> There are good consultants in Moscow right now. </seg>
<seg id="919"> Here in St. Petersburg, there are people who could be experts, but they are pushed to the side, because more advanced experts are needed, who will correctly evaluate these experts and give way to them. </seg>
<seg id="920"> Judgement calls are what thrive now. </seg>
<seg id="921"> Even Erart, but they're different because they say honestly that we don't accept all modern art. There are some artists, who need to find other museums for themselves. </seg>
<seg id="922"> - What does St. Petersburg mean to you? </seg>
<seg id="923"> - St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, Moscow has much more culture, there is bedrock there. </seg>
<seg id="924"> It's hard for art to grow on our rocks. </seg>
<seg id="925"> We need cultural bedrock, but we now have more writers than readers. This is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="926"> In Europe, there are many curious people, who go to art exhibits, concerts. </seg>
<seg id="927"> Here, this layer is thin. </seg>
<seg id="928"> We need to make art fashionable, as it was in the beginning of last century. </seg>
<seg id="929"> The project is supported by the St. Petersburg grant. </seg>
<seg id="930"> Give birth in space </seg>
<seg id="931"> The earth is in danger. </seg>
<seg id="932"> Global warming or an encounter with a killer asteroid. </seg>
<seg id="933"> Caravans of cosmic ships with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet. </seg>
<seg id="934"> To save humanity, the question is how to propagate our race in conditions of weightlessness or on that replacement planet? </seg>
<seg id="935"> I think the choice is small. </seg>
<seg id="936"> There are only two actual planets that can be explored even hypothetically. </seg>
<seg id="937"> "Venus and Mars," says Senior Researcher of the P.K. Shternberg State Astronomy Institute (GAISh) Vladimir Surdin. </seg>
<seg id="938"> But while conditions on Mars are more appropriate for life, Venus has 500-degree temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="939"> Life is possible only at a high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space. </seg>
<seg id="940"> The question of reproduction in space began with flora. </seg>
<seg id="941"> Half a century ago, experiments were run on plants. </seg>
<seg id="942"> Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their earth counterparts. </seg>
<seg id="943"> Then, insects were bred in orbit, small fruit flies. </seg>
<seg id="944"> In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space, to check how an embryo develops in weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="945"> We get an absolutely normal chick. </seg>
<seg id="946"> But then the problem begins. </seg>
<seg id="947"> "The problem is related to the fact that this chick needs to find support, needs to get on its feet and start moving," explains head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) RAN Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="948"> Having found no support, chicks were tumbling around in disorder. </seg>
<seg id="949"> After 10 hours, the newborns experienced complete atrophy of instincts. </seg>
<seg id="950"> Chicks did not react to light and sound. </seg>
<seg id="951"> And the problem was that they simply died after four days. </seg>
<seg id="952"> "We bred chicks twice there, and then stopped, because it is impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev, confirming the failure of the experiment with chicks in space. </seg>
<seg id="953"> The last biological "mini-ark" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="954"> In spring 2013, experiments will continue. </seg>
<seg id="955"> However, only same-sex beings will be on the Bion bio-satellite. </seg>
<seg id="956"> There was an experiment with rats, who were sent to space with foetus. </seg>
<seg id="957"> In principle, there was nothing extraordinary there. </seg>
<seg id="958"> "This was on bio-satellites, but again, it was a singular experiment and such research needs to be conducted," says Vladimir Sychev. </seg>
<seg id="959"> After landing, the cosmic rats had babies. </seg>
<seg id="960"> But it's hard to solve the problem of reproduction directly in space. </seg>
<seg id="961"> It's not an easy task. </seg>
<seg id="962"> Animals simply cannot follow their sexual instinct, when they're out of their familiar environment. </seg>
<seg id="963"> In principle, people, unlike animals, can. </seg>
<seg id="964"> Homo sapiens have abstract thinking, and are able to create a fitting emotional background. </seg>
<seg id="965"> Such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="966"> But women have been flying to space for 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="967"> The biggest risk was for Tereshkova. </seg>
<seg id="968"> The most valuable thing for humanity is the female body. </seg>
<seg id="969"> Our "Seagull" left and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be OK after flying to space. </seg>
<seg id="970"> Whether she will be able to give birth after this flight. </seg>
<seg id="971"> "Nobody answered this question," says rocket and space industry veteran, Vakhtang Vachnadze. </seg>
<seg id="972"> In June 1964, only a year after flying to space, the first woman in space Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter. </seg>
<seg id="973"> The child's father, Andrian Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut. </seg>
<seg id="974"> In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who went into orbit twice and even worked in open space, gave birth to a son. </seg>
<seg id="975"> However, the risk remains. </seg>
<seg id="976"> We have few, very few cosmonauts, who were OK and had healthy children after long flights. </seg>
<seg id="977"> "What's more, it is dangerous even for orbital flights," adds pilot and cosmonaut, Hero of the USSR, Hero of Russia, Valery Poliakov. </seg>
<seg id="978"> And yet, humanity needs to seek out some new avenues in biotechnologies, protection from radiation, creation of artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="979"> Hydro-laboratory of CPK - mandatory phase of training for a flight. </seg>
<seg id="980"> Here, cosmonauts practice skills of working in open space in zero-gravity conditions. </seg>
<seg id="981"> Water imitates weightlessness. </seg>
<seg id="982"> If for adults water is a foreign medium, although comfortable, for infants it is a native element. </seg>
<seg id="983"> Small amphibians seem to confirm that life came to land from the ocean. </seg>
<seg id="984"> There is a connection with the fact that an infant spends about 9 months in amniotic fluid in the womb; it is easier to get used to water after that. </seg>
<seg id="985"> In principle, it is logical, because only two weeks pass from birth until the first bathing. </seg>
<seg id="986"> "This is very little time to forget something," says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova. </seg>
<seg id="987"> In other words, if for a newborn weightlessness is more natural, a woman needs gravity, earth's pull. </seg>
<seg id="988"> Stomach and pelvic muscles usually quickly degenerate in weightlessness; the ability to push out the embryo is reduced. </seg>
<seg id="989"> Well, let's assume that childbirth stimulators will work out. </seg>
<seg id="990"> Maybe she will push out the baby in a special room. </seg>
<seg id="991"> "Then what?" - asks Valery Poliakov about this non-trivial issue. </seg>
<seg id="992"> On the other hand, a baby also needs artificial gravity. </seg>
<seg id="993"> When a body does not feel the earth's pull, it does not form the skeletal and muscular system. </seg>
<seg id="994"> It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit into a special loading suit for training, as they do with adults. </seg>
<seg id="995"> He will simply not have what he needs to survive. </seg>
<seg id="996"> "And this experiment, that we will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to us bringing a handicapped, completely unadapted human to earth," predicts Chairman of the Committee on Bioethics IMBP RAN Igor Pestov. </seg>
<seg id="997"> For the moment, birth of children in space is just a theory. </seg>
<seg id="998"> However, with time, it will become reality, when earthlings will go to a faraway planet in their ships, and it will become the home for their offspring, who were born in space. </seg>
<seg id="999"> NKU Head: Svarc System audit has failed because of politicians. </seg>
<seg id="1000"> The Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts, but it lags behind in their application. </seg>
<seg id="1001"> This was said by Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office (NKU) in an interview for Aktualne.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1002"> "The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion," states Kala, commenting on the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="1003"> Similar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the Czech and German auditors. </seg>
<seg id="1004"> As an example of improper practice, they cite Petr Necas's approach to the so-called "Svarc System." </seg>
<seg id="1005"> The Prime Minister recently claimed that the ODS will not be burdening business owners with its checks - so is it forbidden or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1006"> "The Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohibits something, then even the Government's head cannot prevent the work of its department, which is duty-bound to monitor and enforce," asserts Kala. </seg>
<seg id="1007"> At the audit committee's session in the House of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany, within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared. </seg>
<seg id="1008"> What exactly was this about? </seg>
<seg id="1009"> This is about parallel auditing, which we began around two years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1010"> Simply put, this is about how European legislation governs the handling of public contracts, followed by individual state legislations and then the actual practice itself. </seg>
<seg id="1011"> We brought all this together, and although the audit is not yet complete, some very interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms, our legislation might be even "more concise and complete," however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1012"> This confirms that creating more and more concise rules is not enough, and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws. </seg>
<seg id="1013"> What does this project actually help you with, and what do you think its outcome will bring? </seg>
<seg id="1014"> This kind of joint audit could contribute to curtailing these efforts to specify our law, to reduce and perfect boundaries, when it does not have such a positive impact. </seg>
<seg id="1015"> Economy means acquiring the required thing at a reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price, so that profiteering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1016"> However, just because we have reduced the order limits, does not mean something will be procured. </seg>
<seg id="1017"> The system might become overloaded with the amount of paperwork, and those, who wish to look for loopholes in it, will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher. </seg>
<seg id="1018"> These are domestic problems about the practical implementation of legislation relating to public contracts. </seg>
<seg id="1019"> How does the audit system work in Germany? </seg>
<seg id="1020"> Is there an office like the NKU, or is it organised differently? </seg>
<seg id="1021"> As far as the office is concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof functions like our NKU, and it is organised like ours, it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently, but basically both offices operate similarly. </seg>
<seg id="1022"> Powers are also similar to a degree, though of course Germany is organised federally, so these courts of auditors are also at the member state levels - in this respect their system slightly differs from our own. </seg>
<seg id="1023"> The BRH can only audit federal money, known to us as state funds. </seg>
<seg id="1024"> Public funds, which, for us, are administered by regional and municipal authorities, are audited by the federal courts of auditors there. </seg>
<seg id="1025"> When it comes to their legislation, is it more straightforward than ours? </seg>
<seg id="1026"> Overall, I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data, nevertheless in certain respects Germany serves as an example, but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect. </seg>
<seg id="1027"> Is this because, perhaps, they have better enforcement? </seg>
<seg id="1028"> That is certainly not true, but again, I prefer not to make such comparisons. </seg>
<seg id="1029"> It should be said that even in a country we perceive as exemplary, they encounter a whole range of problems. </seg>
<seg id="1030"> If that were not the case, they would gain nothing from working with our office, would they? </seg>
<seg id="1031"> Coming back to domestic legislation, what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office, is its impact being felt already? </seg>
<seg id="1032"> The period since the amendment came into force has been quite short, so it has not manifested itself in our audit work yet. </seg>
<seg id="1033"> Since we carry out our audits ex-post, a certain delay has to be taken into account. </seg>
<seg id="1034"> As yet, we have only observed it within the process of preparing future audits - we have launched our new "fiscal failure risk detection" system, with which we have processed almost 14 thousand public contracts, and these have been analysed - that is where changes will clearly be seen, because of the changed limits, the adjusted conditions governing certain types of selection processes, and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1035"> So do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit, or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system? </seg>
<seg id="1036"> I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction, and I hope this will be confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="1037"> A problem, which may arise here, is that the law becomes "too constrained" and will not be enforceable. </seg>
<seg id="1038"> Under the previous rules, parties being audited were already bound by their audit provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes, the regional office) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1039"> Is it worth constraining the law in this way, in that case? </seg>
<seg id="1040"> I do not think this is the way. </seg>
<seg id="1041"> The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it, but not penalise those, who make a mistake on a technicality, which does not affect the final decision. </seg>
<seg id="1042"> This kind of system will only increase pressure on bureaucracy. </seg>
<seg id="1043"> So how can we get out of this? </seg>
<seg id="1044"> Let's see where this dead-end takes us. </seg>
<seg id="1045"> The Prime Minister recently said the ODS will not be burdening businessmen with audits of the so-called "Svarc System" - what does this mean? </seg>
<seg id="1046"> Is the Svarc System prohibited or allowed? </seg>
<seg id="1047"> The Law must be set out one way or the other, and if it prohibits something, then even the Government's head cannot prevent the work of its department, which is duty-bound to monitor and enforce. </seg>
<seg id="1048"> He may say: "Let us change this law and relax it," but he cannot say we should pretend it is not there. </seg>
<seg id="1049"> The law on public contracts has relatively strict rules about the formalities which must be adhered to - which is the right way to ensure public tenders are protected. </seg>
<seg id="1050"> On the other hand, it is a tragedy, when a bidder with the best offer is excluded on a technicality. </seg>
<seg id="1051"> The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing, in my opinion. </seg>
<seg id="1052"> Roads are icy in places, but mostly passable. </seg>
<seg id="1053"> In several places in the Czech Republic, the main roads are icy and snowy. </seg>
<seg id="1054"> However, the majority of roads are passable, with extra care needed in places. </seg>
<seg id="1055"> Carlsbad region </seg>
<seg id="1056"> In the Carlsbad region, the roads have been usable this morning, though in some places they were icy and snowy. </seg>
<seg id="1057"> The temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero, though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day. </seg>
<seg id="1058"> Snowing in the region has stopped, and only a thin layer of snow remains in the lowlands. </seg>
<seg id="1059"> However, the ridges of the Krusne Mountains have around 30 centimetres of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1060"> In some locations there is limited visibility due to mist, according to the local highway service. </seg>
<seg id="1061"> The R6 high-speed motorway and primary roads in the region are now usable without restriction. </seg>
<seg id="1062"> Caution is, of course, appropriate, for example, on certain bridges, where the surface can be icy and slippery. </seg>
<seg id="1063"> All secondary and tertiary roads are also passable, including mountain roads. </seg>
<seg id="1064"> In certain stretches of these roads there might be remaining frozen and compacted snow patches. </seg>
<seg id="1065"> Above all, at higher levels, extra care should be taken while driving. </seg>
<seg id="1066"> Pardubice and Hradec Kralove region </seg>
<seg id="1067"> On some roads in Eastern Bohemia, there might be a risk of black ice, at higher altitudes and in the mountains there might be a layer of compacted snow, according to the Road and Motorway Directorate. </seg>
<seg id="1068"> The highway service is warning the drivers against black ice, which might occur at higher altitudes of the Pardubice region in particular. </seg>
<seg id="1069"> Black ice may occur around Lanskroun, Usti nad Orlici, Policky, Svitavy, and Vysoke Myto, and particularly on secondary and tertiary roads. </seg>
<seg id="1070"> The I/43 and I/34 roads have been chemically treated around Svitavy. </seg>
<seg id="1071"> Snow is particularly affecting the roads in the Krkonose and Orlicke mountains. </seg>
<seg id="1072"> At higher altitudes, there is a compacted snow layer on the roads around Rychnov nad Kneznou and Trutnov. </seg>
<seg id="1073"> In Eastern Bohemia the day will be mostly clear to partly cloudy, and dry. </seg>
<seg id="1074"> Temperatures will be between minus three and plus one degree Celsius mostly, with a light wind. </seg>
<seg id="1075"> Pilsen region </seg>
<seg id="1076"> The roads in the Pilsen region have been usable this morning, with extra care needed in some places. Drivers should take the weather conditions into account. </seg>
<seg id="1077"> The morning will be frosty, with temperatures ranging between three and nine degrees below zero. </seg>
<seg id="1078"> Due to the existing snow and subsequent drop in temperature, certain roads may be icy. </seg>
<seg id="1079"> Drivers should expect mist in places, though visibility will gradually improve. </seg>
<seg id="1080"> This information was reported by the region's highway service. </seg>
<seg id="1081"> The D5 motorway is drivable almost without restriction, but the road services recommend extra caution between the 80th and 131st kilometre marks. </seg>
<seg id="1082"> Most primary road surfaces are dry and frost-free. </seg>
<seg id="1083"> Southern areas of the Pilsen and Tachov regions may have icy patches. </seg>
<seg id="1084"> Secondary and tertiary roads are wet, and may therefore also have icy patches. </seg>
<seg id="1085"> Drivers should be cautious especially on less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1086"> Olomouc region </seg>
<seg id="1087"> Drivers should expect snow slush on the roads if heading for the higher parts of the Olomouc region. </seg>
<seg id="1088"> It is a result of the chemical treatment carried out at Cervenohorkse sedlo and on the way to Videlsky Kriz. </seg>
<seg id="1089"> Snowploughs were brought out by falling snow overnight, the Sumperk region, according to highway maintenance, got around three centimetres of snow. </seg>
<seg id="1090"> In other parts of the region, roads are mainly passable without restrictions. </seg>
<seg id="1091"> "In the Sumperk region, traces of snow have remained at the highest altitudes. </seg>
<seg id="1092"> Drivers should expect snow slush at Cervenohorske sedlo in the direction of Jesenik," the dispatch officer for the Sumperk highway service told CTK today. </seg>
<seg id="1093"> Their Jesenik counterparts also made an outing overnight; the roads all the way to the highest altitudes are now clear and wet following the chemical treatment, according to them. </seg>
<seg id="1094"> The Olomouc region's roads are usable without restriction, while in the area of Sternberk drivers should beware in wooded areas, where roads have remained wet. </seg>
<seg id="1095"> Usti nad Labem region, Liberec region </seg>
<seg id="1096"> Since this morning, the snowploughs have reported several places, which are difficult to pass in northern Bohemia. </seg>
<seg id="1097"> Besides certain snow-covered places, or some icy frost patches, the mountain road from Telnice to Kninice in the Usti nad Labem region is also closed, according to the police database. </seg>
<seg id="1098"> Temperatures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain snowy and icy. In the lowlands, however, particularly southeast of the Central Bohemian Uplands, there are no problems and roads are mostly dry. </seg>
<seg id="1099"> No traffic hold-ups have so far been reported. </seg>
<seg id="1100"> Icy frost patches have been reported in particular by road maintenance around Steti. </seg>
<seg id="1101"> According to meteorologists the conditions for this were perfect - rain and melting snow during the day, with a clear night and freezing temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="1102"> Adverse conditions are expected on the main sections of the I/13 road between the Usti nad Labem and Liberec regions. </seg>
<seg id="1103"> The closure of the Telnice to Kninice road was caused by bent tree branches, which were weighed down to road level by snowfall. </seg>
<seg id="1104"> Simon Ornest: At the concerts we want a fusion of positive energy </seg>
<seg id="1105"> What is your opinion on the end of the world that might come in less than a month? </seg>
<seg id="1106"> It is just another startler, which we like to latch on to. </seg>
<seg id="1107"> Together with The Tap Tap band, we tend to joke about it, saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or avert the end of the world completely. </seg>
<seg id="1108"> In December you are even organising a unique series of three concerts against the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="1109"> Can you give our readers some details on this? </seg>
<seg id="1110"> This is a nationwide fund-raising event, which we have been planning for the past two years. </seg>
<seg id="1111"> We decided to make use of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar, due on the 21st of December at 11:10 a.m. </seg>
<seg id="1112"> On the eve, the 20th of December, at 9pm, 3 concerts will take place in parallel in Prague, Brno, and Ostrava. </seg>
<seg id="1113"> They will end at around the time when Kiribati Island in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us, reaches the end of the Mayan calendar. </seg>
<seg id="1114"> Who came up with this idea? </seg>
<seg id="1115"> Initially it was probably my idea, later we worked all the details out with our designer, Honza Augusta. </seg>
<seg id="1116"> Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world, we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts for the state of our planet, when we, one day, hand it over to our children. </seg>
<seg id="1117"> On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also prepared a range of unique items, shoes, t-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, which can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz to support our cause. </seg>
<seg id="1118"> The Tap Tap band, together with other artists, also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world, called "The End of the World is cancelled." </seg>
<seg id="1119"> It is already well received on YouTube, will it figure at the fund-raising concerts? </seg>
<seg id="1120"> Of course, for the grand finale, as long as the world does not end beforehand. </seg>
<seg id="1121"> It will be sung by all the artists at all the three concerts at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="1122"> The anthem will also be featured in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television. </seg>
<seg id="1123"> The words were written and the role of Jesus in the video clip was played by Tomas Hanak, Xindl X also sings in it... </seg>
<seg id="1124"> How did you end up working with them? </seg>
<seg id="1125"> We collaborate also with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, due to organising a lot of fund-raising events and concerts... </seg>
<seg id="1126"> We try to really get them involved in these projects. </seg>
<seg id="1127"> It turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us. </seg>
<seg id="1128"> What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to? </seg>
<seg id="1129"> Equipping the wheelchair-accessible educational Studeo centre, which is already in its sixth year, in collaboration with the citizens association Tap from the Jedlicka Institute for the disabled. </seg>
<seg id="1130"> Tutors come in regularly to spend time with the Jedlicka Institute's students and run activities, which they enjoy and interest them. </seg>
<seg id="1131"> The students themselves do not have the funds to afford tutors, so we try to provide this for them in this way. </seg>
<seg id="1132"> Within the construction project at the Jedlicka Institute, a separate building is planned, which we can move into with this project. </seg>
<seg id="1133"> Every concert sees the appearance of several bands and artists. </seg>
<seg id="1134"> How do you select them? </seg>
<seg id="1135"> We have tried to compile a programme, which speaks for all ages, including children. </seg>
<seg id="1136"> For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiri Suchy will appear. </seg>
<seg id="1137"> Further details can be found at www.kpks.cz. </seg>
<seg id="1138"> Are you planning any more "bombastic events" in the future? </seg>
<seg id="1139"> In May, we will be making our first appearance in the Prague Spring, so we will definitely be preparing a good line-up with some interesting guests. </seg>
<seg id="1140"> Next year, we would like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally - since we will be in the USA - would like to build in appearances in Washington and Chicago. </seg>
<seg id="1141"> Your international plans are not modest; you have already performed, for instance, in Madrid, Brussels, London, and Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="1142"> The Tap Tap is nonetheless a band composed of handicapped people. </seg>
<seg id="1143"> How do you cope with these journeys in terms of logistics and organisation? </seg>
<seg id="1144"> It is not as scary as it might seem at first. </seg>
<seg id="1145"> We have five members in electric wheelchairs, which must be transported in the luggage area; we must also, of course, carry around with us a lot of luggage and instrument cases... </seg>
<seg id="1146"> Nevertheless, we have so far managed it without any problems, CSA and British Airways were well prepared for us, so much so that, on occasion, I was quite surprised. </seg>
<seg id="1147"> Even in Moscow, which we have just returned from, it all went smoothly. </seg>
<seg id="1148"> Thanks to these international trips, you will have had a chance to compare specific accessibility issues, public attitudes to disability and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1149"> What have been your experiences so far? </seg>
<seg id="1150"> After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places, where everything functions better than here, we have just witnessed that in the East everything is still in its beginnings. </seg>
<seg id="1151"> Compared to Prague, Moscow is rather inaccessible; it still remains unusual there for a person in an electric wheelchair to be travelling around the city centre on his or her own. </seg>
<seg id="1152"> Obvious things, such as giving wheelchairs priority in lifts, are not commonplace there. </seg>
<seg id="1153"> Fortunately, citizens associations are emerging there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities. </seg>
<seg id="1154"> And on the other hand, where do we still lag behind more advanced countries? </seg>
<seg id="1155"> There are a lot of things, which we still lag behind on... </seg>
<seg id="1156"> It is important to mention that improvements to the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people who are affected. </seg>
<seg id="1157"> In London and Madrid it is completely natural for people with serious handicaps to be independently out in public, and they can use the toilets, go to the museum, or wherever... </seg>
<seg id="1158"> It is less common there for large groups of people with disabilities to actively take part in social life, in this respect with The Tap Tap we are a step ahead! </seg>
<seg id="1159"> Public respect or accessibility is one thing, but it is only when we can become famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians, or lawyers that things will really begin to change. </seg>
<seg id="1160"> So far there are only exceptional cases, people who are strong-willed. </seg>
<seg id="1161"> The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, but let us look back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to form it? </seg>
<seg id="1162"> I began my job as a tutor at the Jedlicka Institute, where I was surrounded by a lot of young people, who were interested in doing something. </seg>
<seg id="1163"> Since I am a musician myself - among others I play the saxophone - I started a music club with a colleague. </seg>
<seg id="1164"> With time, as our moderator Ladya Angelovic says, it has grown a little out of our control (laugh). </seg>
<seg id="1165"> Your popularity has only come about in the last few years, or am I mistaken? </seg>
<seg id="1166"> It is true that we have been helped by creating ties to famous singers and also by our proactive work on promoting the band. </seg>
<seg id="1167"> We realised that work, which goes on unseen can be like it never existed. </seg>
<seg id="1168"> Thanks to funds from the European Union we can even afford top quality tutors, equipment and so on. </seg>
<seg id="1169"> Was it your goal to take The Tap Tap to such heights? </seg>
<seg id="1170"> From the outset, I felt there was potential to do things a little differently. </seg>
<seg id="1171"> Show business is filled with things, where one imitates the other. </seg>
<seg id="1172"> It is logical in its own way; all new things are taken in hesitantly and take a long time. </seg>
<seg id="1173"> Things, which are unique, are few and far between, but I would dare to claim that Tap Tap is one of those things. </seg>
<seg id="1174"> A person's first impression on seeing you is, of course, pity - it is a natural reaction... </seg>
<seg id="1175"> But that pity is simply wasted, because handicapped people are not abandoned and suffering beings, who need to be pitied. </seg>
<seg id="1176"> They are people, who can fully live life and blossom, assuming, of course, that they have the right environment for it. </seg>
<seg id="1177"> I say that when a person with a handicap succeeds in something, it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1178"> Has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader, as many people are suggesting? </seg>
<seg id="1179"> If we want to achieve top class work, we must be uncompromising in many things and require a certain level of discipline. </seg>
<seg id="1180"> I think this is to be expected. </seg>
<seg id="1181"> Some people come to us with a romantic idea and their head in the clouds, and when they find out they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time travelling to concerts, their enthusiasm quickly disappears. </seg>
<seg id="1182"> That is how it works everywhere, with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something. </seg>
<seg id="1183"> The Tap Tap band currently has twenty members. </seg>
<seg id="1184"> How many of those were present at the beginning in 1998? </seg>
<seg id="1185"> Only one, Ladya Angelovic. </seg>
<seg id="1186"> We are an open group, people come and people go, this is unavoidable. </seg>
<seg id="1187"> Those who have the interest and the drive will always find our door open. </seg>
<seg id="1188"> The event takes place the day before the end of the world is expected, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9pm. </seg>
<seg id="1189"> The venues will be Praha Incheba, Brno Fleda, and Ostrava Plynojem with performances from 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1190"> All three cities will be joined by a televised link-up at the evening's close for a united rendition of The Tap Tap's anthem "The End of the World is cancelled" </seg>
<seg id="1191"> The concert's goal is to raise funds to equip the STUDEO multi-functional wheel-chair accessible learning centre at the Jedlicka Institute in Prague in the sum of 25 million Czech crowns. </seg>
<seg id="1192"> Admission fee to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years of age go free, tickets on sale from Bohemiaticket. </seg>
<seg id="1193"> Poland and the Cosmos. </seg>
<seg id="1194"> Last week the council of ministers of the European Space Agency admitted Poland as the twentieth member of the agency, being the second nation from the former Eastern Block (after the Czech Republic, which became a fully fledged member of the ESA on the 12th of November 2008). </seg>
<seg id="1195"> Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and in the following years it has participated in a series of agency projects. </seg>
<seg id="1196"> Of course, Poland's path to the space had begun much earlier. </seg>
<seg id="1197"> Polish boffins devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War, but were not always met with understanding. </seg>
<seg id="1198"> I look back, for instance, to the lecture of A Sternfeld in Warsaw's astronomy observatory, who, on the 6th of December 1933, presented ideas on his pioneering work Entry into space. </seg>
<seg id="1199"> The thoughts of the young engineer (born 1905) left his audience cold, and years later Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown an interest in his work. </seg>
<seg id="1200"> In 1934, for his work Entry into space, Sternfeld received the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andre Louis Hirsch prize in France. </seg>
<seg id="1201"> The above mentioned Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a strong promoter of astronomy and astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1202"> He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals, and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjects. </seg>
<seg id="1203"> Gadomski became a world-known promoter of astronautics and his contribution was, notably, recognised when a crater on the far side of the Moon was named after him. </seg>
<seg id="1204"> In 1925, Poland had already built a handcar which was supposed to be fitted with a rocket engine. </seg>
<seg id="1205"> Unfortunately, both the project's designer, and the project's details, are unknown. </seg>
<seg id="1206"> It is not even clear, whether the rocket was intended to start the handcar or to slow it down. </seg>
<seg id="1207"> Information about this rail track is only known from press articles of the time. </seg>
<seg id="1208"> In 1933 the Polish artillery started their engagement in flying bombs. </seg>
<seg id="1209"> The research was undertaken by the Weapons Technology Division in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzycki. </seg>
<seg id="1210"> From the documents, it is clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests. </seg>
<seg id="1211"> Of course, the advance of the German army interrupted the research. </seg>
<seg id="1212"> In 1937, the concept of a photoelectric homing rocket designed by engineer Rohozinski appeared in the trade press, and in the following year The Rocket - air torpedo and flying rocket-bomb appeared, authored by Leliwy-Krywoblocki. </seg>
<seg id="1213"> Both projects were destined for military use of rocket engines. </seg>
<seg id="1214"> Immediately prior to the War, all projects for military use of rocket technologies were overseen by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Board (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) that coordinated all the work. </seg>
<seg id="1215"> The Board was appointed in 1937, but after two years of activity their operations were ended by the start of the War. </seg>
<seg id="1216"> Further work devoted to astronautics appeared in the Polish Press after the War thanks to the Polish Astronautics Company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne). </seg>
<seg id="1217"> The first reference to the company figures in the November issue of the magazine Problems in 1954, in which four in-depth articles are on the subject of astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1218"> In one of these, by Prof. Subotowicz, the establishment of a company is proposed, which would dedicate itself to astronautics. </seg>
<seg id="1219"> At the time, there were already projects underway for artificial satellites and it was clear that cosmic research was an emerging sector. </seg>
<seg id="1220"> From the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautics Company (PTA) sought entry to the International Astronautics Federation (est. 1951) and by autumn the PTA was already a full member. </seg>
<seg id="1221"> In the following year, the PTA's first chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) was appointed Deputy Chairman for the International Astronautics Federation. </seg>
<seg id="1222"> He served in this capacity until his death in 1959. </seg>
<seg id="1223"> From 1956, the PTA played a significant role in the successful development of meteorological rockets RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to enable scientific research. </seg>
<seg id="1224"> The first RM-1 model was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on the 10th of October 1958. </seg>
<seg id="1225"> The rocket, with a ceiling of 1800 metres, measured around 80 cm in length and weighed a little under 5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1226"> Later, the improved RM-1A version was constructed and in the summer of 1959 launch tests were initiated for the two-stage RM-2 rocket in the Bledowsky Desert. </seg>
<seg id="1227"> The rocket was 1.4 metres in length and weighed approximately 11.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1228"> A further development model was designed for real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was to reach 14.5 km and be tasked with monitoring high altitude winds. </seg>
<seg id="1229"> Of course, in 1962 further research was stopped. </seg>
<seg id="1230"> The successor to the RM rocket type was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed from 1962 to 1965. </seg>
<seg id="1231"> The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and a launch weight of 32.5 kg. </seg>
<seg id="1232"> Three models were developed (designated Meteor-1A, -1B, and -1C), which differed in the room available for scientific apparatus. </seg>
<seg id="1233"> In the Meteor-1A rocket, a space of 0.4 litres was available, Meteor-1B had 0.34 litres, and Meteor-1C had 0.62 litres. </seg>
<seg id="1234"> The maximum altitude for all three models was 37km. </seg>
<seg id="1235"> Between 1965 and 1968, the development of Meteor-2 was underway in the Aeronautics Institute, with its first launch tests in October 1970. </seg>
<seg id="1236"> The Meteor-2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg, and was capable of lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60km. </seg>
<seg id="1237"> Subsequently built models were the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3. </seg>
<seg id="1238"> Poland's admission to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 should be mentioned, as well as the appointment of a national COSPAR board two years later. </seg>
<seg id="1239"> Poland also participated in the Interkosmos space programme for space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remkov. </seg>
<seg id="1240"> Abolishing the legislation on public works is not the solution. </seg>
<seg id="1241"> Last week the Constitutional Court abolished the law on public works. </seg>
<seg id="1242"> The resolution caused lively public debate. </seg>
<seg id="1243"> It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective. </seg>
<seg id="1244"> Liberally oriented financial systems in the EU, just as those in the globalised world, are based on the principle of an unregulated economic competition. </seg>
<seg id="1245"> Its effect means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves. </seg>
<seg id="1246"> The cause is the principle of free trade and free, completely unregulated movement of private capital together with uncontrolled financial speculation. </seg>
<seg id="1247"> Due to significant labour cost differences (salaries) there is pressure on prices. </seg>
<seg id="1248"> On this basis, it should be understood that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by importing cheap goods, "the rug is pulled" from under the competition's prices to capture a greater market share and, in this way, increase its own profits. </seg>
<seg id="1249"> On a wider scale, this means most businesses must move production abroad, import cheaply from abroad, or close down. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies. </seg>
<seg id="1250"> Since private capital is not bound by social responsibility, and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes, the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase. </seg>
<seg id="1251"> The whole situation is bolstered by the businessman's complete unwillingness to pay taxes, which would alleviate the economical and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit. </seg>
<seg id="1252"> The situation is so well known that there is no need for actual statistical data. </seg>
<seg id="1253"> The ruthless private capital practices create particular economic situations, where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition, aiming to artificially lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment. </seg>
<seg id="1254"> In other words, governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while disregarding the drop in social standards. </seg>
<seg id="1255"> This occurs chiefly in amendments to existing law. </seg>
<seg id="1256"> The aim is to economically force the domestic population to accept prices dictated by private capital, especially in terms of salaries. </seg>
<seg id="1257"> On one hand, this economic system of force, in case of long-term unemployment, on the other, restricted employee rights in the workplace. </seg>
<seg id="1258"> This yields growing poverty and an increasing void between the poor and the rich. </seg>
<seg id="1259"> In Germany there are already a host of food hand-out centres for the poor, who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages. </seg>
<seg id="1260"> The number of these people is already in the millions. </seg>
<seg id="1261"> In the name of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a salary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage. </seg>
<seg id="1262"> Just such a scandal was revealed in the case of auxiliary staff in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1263"> The austerity measures for all the southern EU states will undoubtedly lead to the same situation, where people are pressured by a catastrophic drop in living standards to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to eke out an existence on starvation wages on the edge of society, in the hope that the country will eventually see some foreign investment. </seg>
<seg id="1264"> At this point we have to ask where this may come from? </seg>
<seg id="1265"> If it is to come from other EU states, then poverty is being shifted from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, and African labour is still at a fraction of European wages. </seg>
<seg id="1266"> This applies to all of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="1267"> Liberal theory and the Media incessantly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy, and that a controlled economy leads to economic ruin. </seg>
<seg id="1268"> Private capital cruelly insists on the viewpoint that the State must not intervene in the economy. </seg>
<seg id="1269"> Thereupon, we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence, or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country, for its own selfish ends. </seg>
<seg id="1270"> Here, the answer must be yes. </seg>
<seg id="1271"> The proof is the existence of the almost omnipotent, and in all states, omnipresent lobby. </seg>
<seg id="1272"> The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself through corruption, through mutual benefits and legislation, where almost everything is criminal, but nothing is punishable. </seg>
<seg id="1273"> In Germany the situation is such that state ministries, through lack of financial resources, contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms, who are basically connected with industry. </seg>
<seg id="1274"> These laws are then approved in the Bundestag. </seg>
<seg id="1275"> Real power does not come from the people as the Western-style constitutions claim, but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests. </seg>
<seg id="1276"> It is clear that liberally-orientated democracies will now quickly reach a situation, as is described by Appian in his work on the Roman Republic Crisis in the time of Cesar and Pompei: "The State was already long in complete degeneration and its offices taken by force. </seg>
<seg id="1277"> With bribery, illegal acquisition of benefits, and with stones or swords. </seg>
<seg id="1278"> Bribery and corruption were rife and unhindered, and the people would vote for a result which had been bought" ..."people with principles did not run for office, so on one occasion the whole debacle meant the state went eight months without consuls.." .."There was actually talk about the only answer to this terrible situation being autocracy, and an energetic man should be elected." Appian had Pompei in mind, but it was Cesar who changed democracy for autocracy permanently. </seg>
<seg id="1279"> The conclusion, just as in antiquity, the current society is built on unscrupulous tendencies for personal gain without regard to the interests of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1280"> Private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="1281"> The outcome is now, as it was then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms. </seg>
<seg id="1282"> The causality of the rise of the fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the misguided liberalisation of the economic system in the 19th and 20th centuries. </seg>
<seg id="1283"> The current state of affairs, when we consider the demise of those systems in favour of liberalised democracy as an interlude, can expect its next cycle. </seg>
<seg id="1284"> The particularly catastrophic reality is that the current elite is completely ignoring the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters, which we are already witnessing, as well as crimes against humanity, as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1285"> The abolition of the law on public works is not the answer, at least not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="1286"> Under the pressure of economic competition, internationally as well as within Europe, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways of lowering the population's living standards. </seg>
<seg id="1287"> This pattern is thus systemic. </seg>
<seg id="1288"> To address this, there are targeted political and social reforms, which strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, increase the people's influence over the state and weaken the monopoly held by private capital over society in favour of the state. </seg>
<seg id="1289"> Israel: Chaos Lab. </seg>
<seg id="1290"> "Nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could," from Sting's Fragile, where one of the main verses from the refrain is "Lest we forget how fragile we are." </seg>
<seg id="1291"> "If my sons did not want war, there would be none," said the dying Gutle Schnapper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849. </seg>
<seg id="1292"> The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, as always, has sparked a lot of reaction. </seg>
<seg id="1293"> Some stand by Israel, arguing it has the right to self-defence, and Palestinians are portrayed as terrorists, while others support the Palestinians, claiming racism by the Israeli state, claiming that genocide is being committed against Palestinian Arabs, and that Israel is a terrorist state. </seg>
<seg id="1294"> I do not want to dwell, in these repeated periodic waves of killing, on who is the transgressor and who is the victim, after all, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation, and did not live through the start of the violence. </seg>
<seg id="1295"> I would like to offer the readers a peek behind the scenes, a look at whom, most of all, this 95-year long tension is serving (starting from Balfour's declaration in November 1917) on this small piece of land in the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1296"> Some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts, while others are derived from my own understanding of who, that is, which group of people is the main source of events in modern history. </seg>
<seg id="1297"> Human history is in the first instance about the struggle for power. </seg>
<seg id="1298"> In every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon. </seg>
<seg id="1299"> What is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people, who had chosen their path independently, or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their actions towards a pre-calculated goal. </seg>
<seg id="1300"> We must accept that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of wealth and the power it exudes could not happen in one generation's lifespan. </seg>
<seg id="1301"> Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out, which could be considered the puppet master (whether someone else stands above them, I am unsure, but I would not rule it out) - the Rothschilds. </seg>
<seg id="1302"> Not much is written about them. </seg>
<seg id="1303"> Understandably. </seg>
<seg id="1304"> The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 90's of the 19th century, in order to prevent their name being connected with acts of high criminality, which appeared in their background and which always meant securing power, increasing wealth, or both. </seg>
<seg id="1305"> They hold majority stakes in almost every central bank in the world, and against the countries, where they do not hold a stake, they are either waging or preparing for war (before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after Iraq it was 5, after the overthrow of Kaddafi 4 remained, but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to the Russian Government). </seg>
<seg id="1306"> Whoever attempted to defy this family died. </seg>
<seg id="1307"> Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank to the Rothschild Bank of America, and during the Civil War he began to issue his own (that is state-issued) money and was assassinated in 1865 at the theatre. </seg>
<seg id="1308"> JFK began issuing his own money and wanted to close the Fed (Federal Reserve), and was killed in 1963, Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936, after he had intended to sue the Fed for causing the Great Depression of 1929. </seg>
<seg id="1309"> Their thirst for global power led in the years of 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a three-world-war plan by the freemason leader of the 33rd degree, Albert Pike. </seg>
<seg id="1310"> The first war was to remove the large monarchic state bodies in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule, especially from Great Britain, and the third will reduce the world's population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people (this number of slaves will suffice for their comfort and luxury, and will not use up so many resources), the creation of one universal faith (ecumenism is just an appetiser for this solution), and finally the seizing of absolute power. </seg>
<seg id="1311"> The method, which the group of wealthy families with the Rothschilds leading the way, employ is the instigation of crises, followed by the offering of a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos). </seg>
<seg id="1312"> These solutions are false, however, and always lead to a worse situation (vide establishment of the Fed, so that the crisis of 1907 would not be repeated). </seg>
<seg id="1313"> Thus, having succeeded in assassinating Ferdinand, the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo thereby unleashing World War I, they destroyed tsarist Russia with the Bolshevik revolution. </seg>
<seg id="1314"> The First World War ended abruptly, militarily and economically unsubstantiated, with German capitulation (the war was no longer needed to destroy tsarist Russia) and the central European powers of Austria-Hungary were subsequently dismantled. </seg>
<seg id="1315"> To facilitate the inception of the Second World War, they allowed bankers and politicians to create a latent conflict situation by saddling Germany with huge war reparations, thereby making a radicalist example of the impoverished masses, it remained only to introduce a sufficiently convincing culprit and a leader with a simple solution, while also creating a multi-racial Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed did, the role of a fifth colony, once the war had been ignited. </seg>
<seg id="1316"> At the end of the 19th Century, the Rothschilds instigated the establishment of the Zionist movement, one branch of which strove to form the Jewish State, seeking out an area of historic Judea, Jerusalem, to make its capital (the Return to Zion). </seg>
<seg id="1317"> The aforementioned Balfour Declaration formed the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population. </seg>
<seg id="1318"> Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="1319"> World War II broke out, and whether Hitler broke free from the leash, which international bankers were holding him on, or whether his actions were all part of the plan, is difficult to determine, nevertheless the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the foundation to the world's acceptance of the Jewish State. </seg>
<seg id="1320"> Israel was officially formed in 1948, and just as the war reparations for World War II were layed on Germany, the announcement of the State of Israel became the third war's hotbed. </seg>
<seg id="1321"> Provided the international bankers succeed, the Jewish Nation, as with the second, will be the victims on the front line, now together with the Arabic - or more generally, Muslim - population of the Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="1322"> Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but on an international level (just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel). </seg>
<seg id="1323"> Who is the wrong-doer and who is the victim in the Palestine-Israel conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless cycle of violence, while everything began from the greed of a few and their lust for global power? </seg>
<seg id="1324"> Here, we must differentiate between Israel's general population and their leaders, because, just as it happens here, the international bankers introduce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for. </seg>
<seg id="1325"> Israel's current prime minister, Netanyahu 'the hawk', is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, who does everything to instigate war with Iran, which would, due to its membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, ...) lead to a greater threat of global conflict, and through its control of the Hormuz Strait, where 20% of the world's oil must sail (the channel is only 2 miles wide), to the destruction of the world's economy. </seg>
<seg id="1326"> In what light stand the words, spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order." </seg>
<seg id="1327"> The New World Order in their eyes is one of master and slave. </seg>
<seg id="1328"> A world where the rest of the human population serve the luxury of a handful of financial aristocrats. </seg>
<seg id="1329"> A world, where each new-born is implanted with a chip, which makes their existence completely subjugated. </seg>
<seg id="1330"> "He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. </seg>
<seg id="1331"> If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, </seg>
<seg id="1332"> for it is man's number. His number is six hundred and sixty six." </seg>
<seg id="1333"> Argo: When things are at their worst - call Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1334"> In November 1979, a mob of Islamic student demonstrators took over the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage. </seg>
<seg id="1335"> They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution to the USA, which had actually supported his regime for several decades. </seg>
<seg id="1336"> For the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the Shah overboard, because this would seriously jeopardise the trust of other allied countries. </seg>
<seg id="1337"> The release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, could not be achieved. </seg>
<seg id="1338"> This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later compounded by the fiasco of attempting to free the hostages by force. </seg>
<seg id="1339"> The incarcerated diplomats were finally released after 444 days, following negotiations mediated by the Algerian government. </seg>
<seg id="1340"> Their ordeal provoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian feelings at home. </seg>
<seg id="1341"> The debacle in Iran significantly influenced Jimmy Carter's loss with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1342"> The film Argo, directed by the actor Ben Affleck, recounts one episode in this story, which brought America a small victory. </seg>
<seg id="1343"> Just before the embassy was seized, six employees escaped. </seg>
<seg id="1344"> After some peripeteia, they ended up in the Canadian ambassador's residence. </seg>
<seg id="1345"> The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, succeeded in getting them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they left on Canadian passports as members of a film crew, who were surveying locations for a sci-fi blockbuster. </seg>
<seg id="1346"> A combination of genres </seg>
<seg id="1347"> The plan, conceived by "exfiltration" expert, Tony Mendez, required the assistance of Hollywood. </seg>
<seg id="1348"> For the story to be believed, the film project was reported on in specialist magazines, press conferences were organised, and the fictitious production company had a real office. </seg>
<seg id="1349"> The details of the operation were, for a long time, kept secret; the film draws on the memories of Tony Mendez. </seg>
<seg id="1350"> Affleck's film is a peculiar mix of genres. </seg>
<seg id="1351"> On one hand, there is a realistic incisive political thriller, and at the same time a "caper movie," with small victories and double-crossing - another example would be Ocean's Eleven. </seg>
<seg id="1352"> The mood alternates in the film - on one side, sharp documentary-style sequences in Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic photos from news of the time, relating to the same events portrayed in the film - there are no big differences). </seg>
<seg id="1353"> On the other hand, lighter sections from Hollywood, laced with irony and a little exaggeration. </seg>
<seg id="1354"> Then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other agencies - men in suits debating the situation around meeting tables, in office corridors, over the phone... </seg>
<seg id="1355"> Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in extraordinary style. </seg>
<seg id="1356"> The derided actor has become a respected director, and his acting is no longer the target of ironic comments. </seg>
<seg id="1357"> Argo is his third big-screen movie, following his dark crime movie Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller The Town (2010). </seg>
<seg id="1358"> It is also Affleck's first picture, which does not take place in the director's hometown of Boston. </seg>
<seg id="1359"> The atmospheric feel in different locations is one of the characteristics, which took his earlier films above Hollywood standards. </seg>
<seg id="1360"> Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran is "featured" by Canada. </seg>
<seg id="1361"> The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the siege on the embassy is impressively lucid, creating at once feelings of confusion and surprise, which come flooding in, as history suddenly takes a turn. </seg>
<seg id="1362"> A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his team in the fictitious scenes (the fake staff at the Tehran bazaar). </seg>
<seg id="1363"> Too much action in too many places </seg>
<seg id="1364"> The director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many nail-biting scenes for the film. </seg>
<seg id="1365"> What little there is, is worked well, with some occasional embellishments to reality - these do not all come off so elegantly (the scene, where a looming crisis is averted at Tehran airport by a phone call in America, followed by a chase on the runway seems quite far-fetched). </seg>
<seg id="1366"> Argo's weakness is its divergence, which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places. </seg>
<seg id="1367"> Alan Arkin and John Goodman play their roles as the Hollywood assistants with great charm; their characters deserve more room, and are not by far the only ones in this film. </seg>
<seg id="1368"> Affleck's film loses the dramatic pull a little, it is a film, which can be watched with reasonable interest, its production and retro-style are evocative of thrillers from the 70's. </seg>
<seg id="1369"> It does not really captivate. </seg>
<seg id="1370"> As a reminder of history's particular ways and a testimony to how exaggerated the views are on the all-powerful all-controlling secret services, this will do. </seg>
<seg id="1371"> Rules for blowing up balloons, for bananas and a circus </seg>
<seg id="1372"> The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which issues a poll every year on the most absurd bank charge, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulation or proposal from the EU." </seg>
<seg id="1373"> "We were prompted by the latest story, where the EU plans to take on a 40 percent quota of women at management level of Europe's largest companies," Patrik Nacher, the poll's organiser, told Pravo. </seg>
<seg id="1374"> Among the latest nominated absurdities, for instance, is the recent decision by the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1375"> Until now, women were favoured in life insurance prices, because they constitute a lower risk for insurers. </seg>
<seg id="1376"> "Other unbelievable ideas from the EU can be nominated by anyone until the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="1377"> The actual voting will then take place until the end of February 2013," informed Nacher. </seg>
<seg id="1378"> Among the controversial EU regulations, we might include the mandatory addition of bio-ingredients to fuel, which consequently harms the environment, the ban on reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain a relatively small quantity of a toxic substance, or the rules on the size of chicken cages, which significantly raised egg prices this year. </seg>
<seg id="1379"> The ban on the use of the term "spreadable butter" and the withdrawal of classic light bulbs from sale had previously come under criticism. </seg>
<seg id="1380"> First rate bananas are to measure 14 centimetres </seg>
<seg id="1381"> The Union's machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lobbying group, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by state or group of states' interests (just as the Czech Republic is promoting the demands of its banks under threat of being vetoed). </seg>
<seg id="1382"> The lobby's interests were, for example, that bananas of the highest quality should measure at least 14 cm in the EU, and were not to display and "anomalous curvature." </seg>
<seg id="1383"> The European Commission defended itself, saying that it was only harmonising existing disjointed national standards, which complicated trading. </seg>
<seg id="1384"> Norms relating to fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU despite opposition from certain states, referring to the food waste caused by the existing directives. </seg>
<seg id="1385"> One possible prize-winner in the poll may be the last year's EU regulation according to which inflatable balloons must be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not inflate them without parental supervision. </seg>
<seg id="1386"> Here, the EU pointed to an American research, which indicated that, among other toys, balloons are one of the main causes of child suffocation. </seg>
<seg id="1387"> A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age using party blowers. </seg>
<seg id="1388"> Strange ideas are conceived at home too </seg>
<seg id="1389"> Fairly absurd is the rule relating to individual European officials - everyone in the EU, who holds an official post, may not use the term Macedonia due to it being a sensitive topic for Greece, and instead the acronym FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) should be used. </seg>
<seg id="1390"> The Bankovnipoplatky.com server in collaboration with the Liberal Economist Association, Laissez Faire, also nominated, aside from the aforementioned absurdities, for example the Union's regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state. </seg>
<seg id="1391"> The EU stipulated the maximum volumes of food provisions, which may be present within the CR on the day of our entry to the Union. </seg>
<seg id="1392"> The Czech Republic thereafter exceeded, for instance, the permitted volume of mushroom preserves, which incurred a high penalty. </seg>
<seg id="1393"> The poll's organisers were also impressed by the idea of paying certain countries because they do not have a coastline, or the suggestion of allocating funding for a request for funding. </seg>
<seg id="1394"> These ideas did not come from Brussels, however, but from Prague. </seg>
<seg id="1395"> "We are handicapped because we do not have the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1396"> We are asking the European Union for a refund," declared the minister for agriculture, back in autumn 2004, Jaroslav Palas (CSSD). </seg>
<seg id="1397"> His argument was that there had been a good harvest of cereals, and due to the so-called buy-out interventions, the state's warehouses were full and were forced to export. </seg>
<seg id="1398"> The Czech Republic is further away from a port, so according to Palas the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of Euros. </seg>
<seg id="1399"> The European Commission finally met the CR halfway by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea. </seg>
<seg id="1400"> Funding to subsidise funding requests was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Regional Development's minister, Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from Brussels. </seg>
<seg id="1401"> EU: Bizarre legislation is the exception </seg>
<seg id="1402"> Regulations may well become the target of criticism among member states, but the EU's efforts at regulation, more effective operation, and development of the entire Union deserve recognition, according to a number of experts. </seg>
<seg id="1403"> A more important issue, according to experts, is the drawing of EU funds on projects, which have hardly anything in common with strengthening the European integration, but which was pushed through by member states during a budget meeting. </seg>
<seg id="1404"> Emotions flare among Czechs when, just as other countries in the Union, the CR must fight in Brussels for the right to particular labelling on its traditional products, in which it does not always succeed. </seg>
<seg id="1405"> The Czechs fought for six years with the Germans and Austrians to protect the labelling of their Olomoucke tvaruzky, however the tuzemsky rum, whose tradition reaches back to the 19th century here, had to be renamed tuzemak by the manufacturers. </seg>
<seg id="1406"> The appellation of rum can only be given to products distilled from cane sugar, and not sugar beet. </seg>
<seg id="1407"> Carlsbad wafers, Pohorelicky and Trebonsky carp, and Zatec hops have been added to the official list of registered products of the EU, alongside the world-renowned feta cheese and gorgonzola, German marzipan from Lubeck, and Parma ham. </seg>
<seg id="1408"> The EU's stamp of protection can also be proudly shown on Pardubice gingerbread and Horicky tubes. </seg>
<seg id="1409"> People want me to save the republic, but I am an amateur, says Okamura </seg>
<seg id="1410"> Senator, how does a person decide they want to run for President? </seg>
<seg id="1411"> This is not about me being a senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1412"> If everything in our country worked without problems, then I would not be running for any post. </seg>
<seg id="1413"> I cannot watch any longer the country having been robbed over the past twenty years, thieves roaming about there and people's taxes and retirement age increasing. </seg>
<seg id="1414"> I had no ambition to be a politician. </seg>
<seg id="1415"> When I see something I do not like, though, I try to find a solution to change things. </seg>
<seg id="1416"> Since I have already turned forty, and I am an independent non-party man, I have no other choice to influence things but to stand for senator or president. </seg>
<seg id="1417"> You have already reached the Senate, but shortly after that you are taking off for the Castle. </seg>
<seg id="1418"> Are you not turning your back on those who voted for you in doing this? </seg>
<seg id="1419"> I have been saying the entire time that I would fight for the Castle based on the results in the Senate's elections. </seg>
<seg id="1420"> Later, I added that if I were elected as senator, I would be standing for president. </seg>
<seg id="1421"> My goal, though, is not the post, the post is a tool to allow my vision to be realised. </seg>
<seg id="1422"> Therefore, I need the greatest influence, and the strongest mandate possible. </seg>
<seg id="1423"> The trouble is not just that as a nation we swear in the pub or at the television, but that we trample anyone, who wants to try to change things. </seg>
<seg id="1424"> The Media add to this, misleading the public, and mistaking freedom of speech with freedom to lie. </seg>
<seg id="1425"> For example, I was allegedly bribing reporters, or I was allegedly an advisor of Jiri Paroubek. </seg>
<seg id="1426"> Let's talk about your vision. </seg>
<seg id="1427"> You set out on your castle siege with a thesis on the material and criminal responsibilities of politics, and a retroactive financial disclosure of assets over twenty million. </seg>
<seg id="1428"> You need to change the law for this. </seg>
<seg id="1429"> As president, though, you do not have this power, and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws. </seg>
<seg id="1430"> How are you going to solve this? </seg>
<seg id="1431"> When I lobbied, as a citizen, for tour guide work to be a free trade, it was successfully carried through. </seg>
<seg id="1432"> The problem is political squabbling - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right, it will be deliberately rejected, causing delays for the public. </seg>
<seg id="1433"> As an independent non-party man, I stand a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides. </seg>
<seg id="1434"> The advantage I hold is that without the political pigeonholing or dogmas I can take what is best for our country from any side, and apply it. </seg>
<seg id="1435"> Do you see yourself as a person from the right, or the left? </seg>
<seg id="1436"> From the Czech viewpoint, it seems they tend to put me to the left. </seg>
<seg id="1437"> For me, it just does not matter if it is a little to the left or right. </seg>
<seg id="1438"> The important part for me is moving forward. </seg>
<seg id="1439"> It is not about whether someone is from the left or right, I just want to bring people together. </seg>
<seg id="1440"> I always support any good public solutions, even if they are put forward by the KSCM or the ODS, and, in the same way, I will oppose bad ideas. </seg>
<seg id="1441"> You get angry when someone calls you a populist. </seg>
<seg id="1442"> Are you not confirming this with what you have stated? </seg>
<seg id="1443"> When you make a company business plan, you also have some ideal goal and vision. </seg>
<seg id="1444"> You try to come close to it. </seg>
<seg id="1445"> Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere, or they have been put forward by experts. </seg>
<seg id="1446"> But without the support of the Parliament you will be left with just slogans. </seg>
<seg id="1447"> You will not last long in politics with that. </seg>
<seg id="1448"> Or do you believe that if you walk among the public and talk with them, that you will succeed, say, in passing criminal and material responsibility? </seg>
<seg id="1449"> I have no alternative. </seg>
<seg id="1450"> I need to convince politicians, reporters, and the public, and try to get them on my side, so we can put this through. </seg>
<seg id="1451"> If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to arrange a live television broadcast, where I ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges, and the Attorney General. </seg>
<seg id="1452"> And, as the case may be, they would need to explain why they did not want this. </seg>
<seg id="1453"> When there is a strong figure to point out the issues, it just needs some pressure on the political scene. </seg>
<seg id="1454"> Take for instance the direct election of the president, it was achieved thanks to public pressure. </seg>
<seg id="1455"> I will say frankly that I am an amateur, I am not a genius or an intellectual. </seg>
<seg id="1456"> I am looking for allies to share my opinions and vision. </seg>
<seg id="1457"> I have just started out in politics, and I am looking for a majority support for my agenda. </seg>
<seg id="1458"> I will try to make things progress, but it if does not work out, in six years I will finish and return to the private sector. </seg>
<seg id="1459"> It sounds a little like Okamura is trying to save the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1460"> I am no saviour. </seg>
<seg id="1461"> I know that alone I will not achieve anything, so I have asked acquaintances, whether they would run for the senate. </seg>
<seg id="1462"> I went to Radim Jancura, who declined due to his workload. </seg>
<seg id="1463"> So I, at least, support investigative journalist, Jana Lorencova, who uncovered fraudulent activity with light heating oil. </seg>
<seg id="1464"> I put myself forward, because people are really discontented, but now I have my doubts. </seg>
<seg id="1465"> Sixty percent of people did not go to vote, and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the establishment. </seg>
<seg id="1466"> In the senate, there are only two independents, including me. </seg>
<seg id="1467"> People have voted for a senate that will make it difficult to enforce changes. </seg>
<seg id="1468"> Nonetheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors or regional council presidents. </seg>
<seg id="1469"> Are you considering having your own party? </seg>
<seg id="1470"> I have not considered it yet, because I have neither the time to verify that every party member has a clean background, nor the money to do it. </seg>
<seg id="1471"> I have no money even for a presidential campaign, my transparent account holds just 20 thousand. </seg>
<seg id="1472"> You have no money? </seg>
<seg id="1473"> You are talking about financial disclosures, but what is yours like? </seg>
<seg id="1474"> I estimate my private assets to be around 60 million. </seg>
<seg id="1475"> In Prague, I have land worth around 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth eight million, an artwork collection worth around ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million, a Skoda Superb worth a million, and I have a few million in my account. </seg>
<seg id="1476"> I have the Aston Martin, by the way, because it was my dream as a boy - I always liked James Bond, who drove the car, was gallant with women and also fought against evil and villainy. </seg>
<seg id="1477"> You drive an Aston Martin, have assets worth 60 million, but you have no money for a campaign? </seg>
<seg id="1478"> You say you want to change the Republic, but you are not keen on putting your own money into it. </seg>
<seg id="1479"> This does not inspire much confidence. </seg>
<seg id="1480"> I do not have 15 million for a campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1481"> Should I take out a loan? </seg>
<seg id="1482"> I have already put 2.5 million into the campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1483"> The fact that I do not have any sponsors is evidence that there is no real interest in my programme. </seg>
<seg id="1484"> I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign. </seg>
<seg id="1485"> The expenditure on my campaign is basically covered by the pay I will be receiving as a senator. </seg>
<seg id="1486"> However, I would not be able to live on it, for instance, I could not pay for my son's English school, which costs 30 thousand a month. </seg>
<seg id="1487"> If I were only interested in making money, I would not be standing for election. </seg>
<seg id="1488"> So you will still be in business so that you can make a living? </seg>
<seg id="1489"> Did you not say you would be putting this on hold? </seg>
<seg id="1490"> This depends on the rate of pay. </seg>
<seg id="1491"> As I promised, my activities have been partially reduced. </seg>
<seg id="1492"> For example, my deputy is taking over as the CEO of the travel agency in spring. </seg>
<seg id="1493"> People would like me to be a Samaritan, who saves the Republic. </seg>
<seg id="1494"> But I must also live off something. </seg>
<seg id="1495"> As a businessman, what would you usually make monthly? </seg>
<seg id="1496"> Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I still do. </seg>
<seg id="1497"> And if I became president, then I would end my business activity. </seg>
<seg id="1498"> The full interview can be read in Saturday's issue of Pravo. </seg>
<seg id="1499"> The MVRDV architects prove that true adventures are not just in the head - drawing on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently erected Bücherberg (literally "book mountain") - 2 photos </seg>
<seg id="1500"> "I think the building is fun, looks futuristic and ultimately provides something interesting to look at," said Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by at the road-side. </seg>
<seg id="1501"> And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a major firm based nearby commented: "It's definitely a thing of beauty, the building." </seg>
<seg id="1502"> However, I do wonder why people would need another library in this day and age. </seg>
<seg id="1503"> Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and eBooks. </seg>
<seg id="1504"> No-one goes into one of these old-style libraries voluntarily nowadays, or am I wrong? </seg>
<seg id="1505"> Spijkenisse, a sleepy town outside the gates of Rotterdam, which barely merits a visit, is a special record-holder. </seg>
<seg id="1506"> The 80,000-resident municipality has the lowest literacy rate in the whole of the Netherlands. </seg>
<seg id="1507"> In order to counteract this asinine situation, the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges that feature on the Euro notes as pretty, painted reinforced concrete miniatures. </seg>
<seg id="1508"> The success of the education offensive was limited. </seg>
<seg id="1509"> And so the city fathers acknowledged that there was only one way to become master over the statistics: a library had to be built! </seg>
<seg id="1510"> Winy Maas of the Rotterdam-based architectural firm MVRDV, master of audacious bar charts and producer of humorous and often cynical buildings, took the project on with his customary composure, and turned up at the competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face. </seg>
<seg id="1511"> And with the judging panel still looking at him with bewilderment, shrugging their shoulders, the impertinent Maas stacked his chosen props by order of size to form a pyramid and rounded off his presentation - now suitably backed up with action - with the words: "Dear Municipality!" </seg>
<seg id="1512"> So this is my suggestion for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain - for the so-called Boekenberg! </seg>
<seg id="1513"> Nine years later, the 30-million-euro mountain has been lifted up. </seg>
<seg id="1514"> It is part of a revitalisation project, which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a small number of adjacent apartment buildings and terraced houses, with a total of 50 dwellings. </seg>
<seg id="1515"> At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded second place in the "Best Library of NL 2012" competition. </seg>
<seg id="1516"> In addition, the project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1517"> Thus, the faceless small-town retort, that until now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and a stunningly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would expect to find a dairy plant, has been bolstered by a piece of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="1518"> First and foremost, however, Spijkenisse now has its first public cultural building in the history of its existence. </seg>
<seg id="1519"> The long journey to the book </seg>
<seg id="1520"> The first impression: the Eldorado of books beneath a cheese dome. </seg>
<seg id="1521"> There is in fact a lift that climbs through the centre of the mountain massif, however, the true joys of space and literature are revealed when scaling the topography on foot. </seg>
<seg id="1522"> The interior space, glazed throughout, is bright and open, the fired clinker floors and the elegant street lamps speak the unmistakable language of a public town square. </seg>
<seg id="1523"> The urban ambiance is perfect. </seg>
<seg id="1524"> You are already on the lookout for a park bench, a dog, and boys and girls playing football. </seg>
<seg id="1525"> And everywhere there are books, books, books. </seg>
<seg id="1526"> "Normally book shelves run along the facade, and in the centre there is a large, dark space, which is usually unpleasant and impersonal," says Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1527"> We turned the classical spatial configuration on its head and turned the reading area inside out. </seg>
<seg id="1528"> The interior of the Bücherberg is cleverly used: in the centre there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental centre and the central technical support room. </seg>
<seg id="1529"> One particularly special feature are the black book shelves, which simultaneously act as wall cladding, parapets and railings for the stairway. </seg>
<seg id="1530"> The appearance, feel and scent are foreign. </seg>
<seg id="1531"> Even die-hard architects and construction engineers shake their heads at the unknown construction materials. </seg>
<seg id="1532"> "Here we wanted to work with recyclable materials," explained Joop Trouborst, Project Manager for the Municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the Standard. </seg>
<seg id="1533"> And thus one day we stumbled across a suitable waste product used in agriculture, on a Frisian farm. </seg>
<seg id="1534"> For many years, millimetre-thick artificial fabric has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a base layer. </seg>
<seg id="1535"> It is inexpensive and saves time. </seg>
<seg id="1536"> The thin textile lasts for two seasons and is then disposed of as bulk waste. </seg>
<seg id="1537"> For the library, the fabric was - for the first time in these quantities - pressed into four-centimetre-thick boards. </seg>
<seg id="1538"> Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouw plastic (KLP) changes colour to a dark, homogeneous and robust material, that smells like a mixture of new car smell and the smell of trainers. </seg>
<seg id="1539"> After 105 steps you have reached the summit. </seg>
<seg id="1540"> At the end of the 500-meter-long journey, you are rewarded in the Literature Café, not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees. </seg>
<seg id="1541"> These provide atmosphere, but most importantly, regulate the air humidity in the literary mountain range. </seg>
<seg id="1542"> Donations for the new soul </seg>
<seg id="1543"> "You would hardly believe it, but this building, in spite of the many glass panels, is a showcase project in the area of ecology," said Trouborst. </seg>
<seg id="1544"> It is heated and cooled using geothermal heat. </seg>
<seg id="1545"> Although the Bücherberg has a glass cover, the sun only shines only briefly into the interior, even on sunny days. </seg>
<seg id="1546"> The broad, laminated wood glue beams positioned at right-angles to the glass facade, provide shade and absorb the majority of the sunlight. </seg>
<seg id="1547"> The indoor temperature is very pleasant. </seg>
<seg id="1548"> The rest is taken care of by fully automatic roller blinds. </seg>
<seg id="1549"> Stefan Spermon, initially a sceptic of the IT sector, has already ventured into the new library. </seg>
<seg id="1550"> Lisette Verhaig has also visited already. </seg>
<seg id="1551"> So too has TCM-teacher, Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "long overdue soul." </seg>
<seg id="1552"> The reason: At the inauguration just a few weeks ago, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his/her personal collection. </seg>
<seg id="1553"> This was, for the time being, to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently there are 70,000 items. </seg>
<seg id="1554"> The concept has been a success. </seg>
<seg id="1555"> The shelves are full to capacity. </seg>
<seg id="1556"> "Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," said architect Winy Maas. </seg>
<seg id="1557"> "I think that, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain bond with this new building. </seg>
<seg id="1558"> Everyone knows that their book is part of the building. </seg>
<seg id="1559"> Even if it's just for decoration. </seg>
<seg id="1560"> As such, MVRDV have succeeded in mastering the master discipline that specialist jargon refers to as the formation of identity. </seg>
<seg id="1561"> Spijkenisse has written literary history. </seg>
<seg id="1562"> However young and uneducated it may be. </seg>
<seg id="1563"> This is ultimately a starting point for identity. </seg>
<seg id="1564"> Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role" </seg>
<seg id="1565"> In the vote on the incorporation of Palestine, Germany abstained from voting. </seg>
<seg id="1566"> According to Stephen Szabo, Expert in US-European relations, in so doing Berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line. </seg>
<seg id="1567"> Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the Palestinians' application for observer status within the United Nations. </seg>
<seg id="1568"> However, Berlin subsequently abstained from voting. </seg>
<seg id="1569"> Why? </seg>
<seg id="1570"> Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza. </seg>
<seg id="1571"> Now, however, due to their special relationship with Israel, Germany must be cautious. </seg>
<seg id="1572"> At the same time, however, I do not believe that it supports the American position either. </seg>
<seg id="1573"> Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - albeit without being too critical of Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1574"> During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany likewise abstained from voting, when it came to establishing a no-fly zone. </seg>
<seg id="1575"> This was ultimately implemented by NATO. </seg>
<seg id="1576"> Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position when it comes to important international affairs? </seg>
<seg id="1577"> Yes, it does. </seg>
<seg id="1578"> That is because it has just reorganised its foreign policy, indeed moving away from a policy that was, so to speak, managed by the USA, in favour of a German foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1579"> This situation is aggravated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and standardised policy. </seg>
<seg id="1580"> The Germans thus find themselves caught between two fronts. </seg>
<seg id="1581"> It is expected of them that they play a more independent role, yet this is something that they are not accustomed to. </seg>
<seg id="1582"> I believe that they are still finding their way in this role, but they are en route to a "more normal" foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="1583"> A foreign policy similar to that of France, or Great Britain. </seg>
<seg id="1584"> So what specifically does a "normal" foreign policy entail, from a German perspective? </seg>
<seg id="1585"> It shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters, which are independent of those of the USA or European partners. </seg>
<seg id="1586"> I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, that is, by export and its relations with certain regions such as Russia, China or the Near East. </seg>
<seg id="1587"> Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests. </seg>
<seg id="1588"> Have these economic interests had an influence on their attitude towards the Near East conflict and their voting in the UN? </seg>
<seg id="1589"> On the one hand, Germany has major revenue markets in the Near East, and particularly in the Gulf States. </seg>
<seg id="1590"> Therefore it must be careful not to affront the public, but also the elite in the Arabic countries. </seg>
<seg id="1591"> In any case, this plays a role. </seg>
<seg id="1592"> However, I wouldn't want to ascribe too much weight to this. This is not an entirely one-sided relationship. </seg>
<seg id="1593"> Nonetheless, it does play an important role in Germany's considerations. </seg>
<seg id="1594"> Has Germany damaged its relations with the USA, by abstaining to vote on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine? </seg>
<seg id="1595"> I think that in Europe, and even in the USA, a great understanding for the German position prevails. </seg>
<seg id="1596"> Therefore I do not think that this was as dramatic a fracture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya. </seg>
<seg id="1597"> Perhaps it will even earn Germany a certain degree of respect. </seg>
<seg id="1598"> After all, it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered. </seg>
<seg id="1599"> In Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative. </seg>
<seg id="1600"> The USA, on the other hand, have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto. </seg>
<seg id="1601"> Are there differences of opinion between the USA and the many European nations? </seg>
<seg id="1602"> Due to the American domestic policy, these differences have always existed. </seg>
<seg id="1603"> I think that secretly, the government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation. </seg>
<seg id="1604"> However, due to the political situation here, the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly. </seg>
<seg id="1605"> It is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so vast as they always appear. </seg>
<seg id="1606"> If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is really not quite so enthused by Netanjahu's policies. </seg>
<seg id="1607"> Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand, and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other? </seg>
<seg id="1608"> I think that this is precisely what makes things so difficult for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1609"> It would of course be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and standardised European policy, which is currently not the case. </seg>
<seg id="1610"> Thus they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position. </seg>
<seg id="1611"> This is precisely what they are doing with the Euro. </seg>
<seg id="1612"> I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in urging Europe towards a standardised European position. </seg>
<seg id="1613"> This is, of course, no simple task for Germany, on account of its relations with Israel. </seg>
<seg id="1614"> This has always been a sensitive subject. </seg>
<seg id="1615"> Yet I do think that Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role. </seg>
<seg id="1616"> Does Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player - does Germany actually want to assume a leading role? </seg>
<seg id="1617"> Or does Germany still find leadership roles difficult? </seg>
<seg id="1618"> Germany is still not used to it, the country continues to be uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role. </seg>
<seg id="1619"> If we look at the Euro crisis for example, every time that Germany assumes a more prominent role, various anti-German feelings become apparent. </seg>
<seg id="1620"> This does not make matters simple for the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="1621"> This is actually the same old problem: one does not want to be surrounded by hostile countries. </seg>
<seg id="1622"> From this stance, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA. </seg>
<seg id="1623"> It must be receptive to the most diverse of neighbours and opinions, and this is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="1624"> The influence of the USA over European politics is continually diminishing, yet the EU is currently not feeling this vacuum, so who is filling the gap? </seg>
<seg id="1625"> The Germans will simply have to play a greater role. </seg>
<seg id="1626"> Even if they do not like it, even if it is uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie! </seg>
<seg id="1627"> Stephen Szabo is associate director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute in which academics and political experts from Europe and North America come together to research the challenges of the transatlantic community. </seg>
<seg id="1628"> Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, in which he has specialised in German policy, US foreign policy and transatlantic relations. </seg>
<seg id="1629"> "Brand protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese </seg>
<seg id="1630"> Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren likewise. </seg>
<seg id="1631"> However, what is Armani Polo? </seg>
<seg id="1632"> Behind this name hides a fully officially registered brand in China, however, one that has nothing whatsoever to do with the original companies. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> Nonetheless, it is enjoying protection, provided the actual creators of the names do not sue. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> And even then it is not clear whether they will have any rights. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> "It is becoming increasingly more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," said Thomas Pattloch, lawyer within the Taylor Wessing law firm, who specialises in copyright infringement in the Far East. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> Every week a new case lands on my desk. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> All the copycats require are a few additional letters in order that they can register their brands. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> Thus Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, Prada-Kny is registered in place of Prada. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> German companies are also 'legally' copied in this manner, such as manufacturer of sporting apparel, Puma. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> Pattloch opens a file containing registrations with the trademark office in Peking. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company copyrighted the brand name Zegna DF Puma there, an alias that also helps itself to the name of fashion retailer Ermenegildo Zegna. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing on intellectual property is well-known. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> In the major cities there are multi-level department stores that sell counterfeit goods almost exclusively. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> Pattloch's cases, however, are slightly different: on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the trademark office, fully officially, which is already protected elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="1645"> The Chinese call this "Bang Mingpai," a passenger brand. </seg>
<seg id="1646"> The word is based on "Bang Dakuan." </seg>
<seg id="1647"> This refers to women who latch onto rich men. </seg>
<seg id="1648"> The Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="1649"> "This harms business and we must fight against it," challenges Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> "The brand is watered down, its uniqueness disappears - the image damage is enormous." </seg>
<seg id="1651"> The financial losses and process costs of the affected branches amount into the millions, especially in the case of expensive flagship products. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> According to information from market research company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros annually, China is the third largest market for luxury items, and the fastest growing. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> However, the deletion of dubious entries in the trademark registry are difficult to achieve, and cost a pretty penny. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> The process can last for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> Pattloch reports of instances whereby the court dismisses cases, because after a long period of time, the name to which the objection is being raised has become a "market reality." </seg>
<seg id="1656"> If the complainant is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarist money for having infringed on his trademark in China, said Pattloch. </seg>
<seg id="1657"> Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here. </seg>
<seg id="1658"> Famous cases also relate to graphic elements. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently acquired German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> Even today, the Chinese company is therefore permitted to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> Volvo-purchaser Geely originally used a blue and white logo that resembled the BMW logo; the dispute was arbitrated and Geely was forced to change it. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> Fashion house Lacoste lost a suit in China against copycats from Hong Kong and Singapore, who were using the famous crocodile looking in the other direction. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> The Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrongdoing. </seg>
<seg id="1664"> The CTMO trademark office in Peking does acknowledge that there were bottlenecks in 2010 due to limited staffing and equipment. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> In the past year, however, things reportedly "returned to normal following this emergency situation regarding the work flow." </seg>
<seg id="1666"> Thus the stock of unprocessed appeal proceedings was reduced by 22 percent. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> Almost 57,000 such cased were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> Nonetheless, there are still 81,500 appeals waiting to be resolved in the office. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> To remedy this is very expensive </seg>
<seg id="1670"> As is so often the case in China, the figures are imposing. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> In the past year, more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were submitted to the CTMO, almost one third more than in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> This is a record and means that China, for the tenth time in succession, is the global leader when it comes to new trademark applications, informed the authority. </seg>
<seg id="1673"> The same applies for the inventory of valid trademarks, totalling 5.5 million in number. </seg>
<seg id="1674"> In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were received. </seg>
<seg id="1675"> Put simply, this means that each application costs on average 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros. </seg>
<seg id="1676"> To appeal against an application costs many times this amount, as can be seen in the case of the German family business, Freudenberg. </seg>
<seg id="1677"> For more than seven years, the group has been contesting against a Chinese plagiarist. </seg>
<seg id="1678"> The Germans did in fact manage to expose the company's illegal manufacturing of copied motor vehicle parts. </seg>
<seg id="1679"> However, the copycat still secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand. </seg>
<seg id="1680"> This is something we missed ourselves, as family names cannot be protected in Germany, said Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Board of Management at Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich. </seg>
<seg id="1681"> The CTMO trademark office then also dismissed the Munich-based company's appeal. </seg>
<seg id="1682"> In the next two instances, Freudenberg was proven right, however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day. </seg>
<seg id="1683"> You have to pay extremely careful attention. </seg>
<seg id="1684"> The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court. </seg>
<seg id="1685"> Wentzler is confident that the matter will be brought to a positive conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts. </seg>
<seg id="1686"> However, he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves." </seg>
<seg id="1687"> The internal costs can barely be calculated, the company archive even had to look through century-old records in order to provide proof. </seg>
<seg id="1688"> Five years ago Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a "high six-figure sum in euros" as settlement. </seg>
<seg id="1689"> "This shows how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1690"> The dangers in the Far East even threaten to spilling over, back into Europe. </seg>
<seg id="1691"> Particularly if imitators secure unprotected brand names there. </seg>
<seg id="1692"> For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Freudenberg label for shoes and leather in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1693"> This is a business sector that the group had long vacated, yet nonetheless managed to prevent the registration. </seg>
<seg id="1694"> "You have to pay extremely careful attention," says Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1695"> Both he and Pattloch advise companies to be very careful when conducting business with China. </seg>
<seg id="1696"> It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights, rather foreigners should also register "everything" that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well," said Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> Otherwise costs can be much more expensive than the registration fee. </seg>
<seg id="1698"> In actual fact: if Freudenberg were to loose at the final hurdle of its trademark drama, they would probably have to pay the opposing party license fees for the use of their own name, explained Wentzler. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Or alternatively we would be forced out of the market in the respective sector. </seg>
<seg id="1700"> World AIDS day: Stomp, sing, help </seg>
<seg id="1701"> In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing - and in the Swaziland, AIDS orphans are delighted. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> The history of a link that overcomes far more than a distance of 8,733 kilometres. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> First of all, the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' pumps and men's loafers attempt to find the beat on the parquet floor, and quickly do just that. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> One-two-three-four. </seg>
<seg id="1705"> Only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - alto, bass, tenor and soprano surge, beguile and haunt. </seg>
<seg id="1706"> And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost rises up out of his shoes as he brings the ensemble together with his smooth, yet wild gestures. </seg>
<seg id="1707"> It is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi Choir are practising a new song. </seg>
<seg id="1708"> The fifteen singers, aging from 23 to 69 years old, range from human geneticists to the maintenance man. </seg>
<seg id="1709"> "Om'Obani" is by no means a simple piece, with each voice having a different text, and in an extremely foreign language at that: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland. </seg>
<seg id="1710"> Helping others to help themselves </seg>
<seg id="1711"> There are around 34 million people infected with HIV around the world, as according to the estimations of Unaids, the United Nations' programme to battle AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="1712"> Of these, 23.5 million live in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> In Swaziland, there are 245,000 AIDS orphans. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> Meanwhile, more than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive. </seg>
<seg id="1715"> The Voices for Africa Association has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni. </seg>
<seg id="1716"> 70 of these attend a secondary school. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can become a sponsor. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> This guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a warm meal each day in the Gogo Centre. </seg>
<seg id="1719"> In Zulu, Imbongi means storyteller or worshipper. </seg>
<seg id="1720"> In this region, no-one can speak the Bantu language fluently, but they can sing it. </seg>
<seg id="1721"> For almost ten years the choir has been practising songs in this foreign, 'soft' language, and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from: the South of Africa. </seg>
<seg id="1722"> For an 8,733-kilometre flight away from Heidelberg, in the north west of the Swaziland Kingdom, lies the village of Esitjeni, which relies on the vocal power of the German choir. </seg>
<seg id="1723"> Forty percent are infected. </seg>
<seg id="1724"> Around 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, and the majority of them are children. </seg>
<seg id="1725"> More than 300 of them no longer have parents, as they succumbed to the HIV virus. </seg>
<seg id="1726"> In Esitjeni you get a small foreshadow of the illness from which all of Swaziland is suffering: according to Unicef, the region has the highest HIV infection rates and the lowest life expectancy in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1727"> Circumcision, which has been proven to reduce the risk of contracting the virus by half, is barely practised by the population. </seg>
<seg id="1728"> More than forty percent of people in the Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, and dying in you mid-thirties is by no means rare. </seg>
<seg id="1729"> On a group trip to Africa in early 2005, the Choir visited the village, but first and foremost, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, lacking not only in parental care but in practically everything else as well: food, clothing, education. </seg>
<seg id="1730"> Without a school leaving certificate, there are barely any opportunities, particularly in a poor country. </seg>
<seg id="1731"> Initially it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school and enable him/her to have one warm meal a day for a few euros per year. </seg>
<seg id="1732"> However, just one year later, the choir established the "Voices for Africa" Association, which since then has been looking after the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni at an almost professional level. </seg>
<seg id="1733"> Facts on sexually transmitted infections. </seg>
<seg id="1734"> What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases? </seg>
<seg id="1735"> Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhoea. </seg>
<seg id="1736"> Common viral STIs are HIV, human papilloma viruses, herpes genitalis and hepatitis. </seg>
<seg id="1737"> Crabs and scabies belong among the parasitic STIs. </seg>
<seg id="1738"> Who are the main affected groups? </seg>
<seg id="1739"> Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur primarily in men that have intercourse with other men. </seg>
<seg id="1740"> The Robert Koch Institute understands that at least four in five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by means of sexual contact between men. </seg>
<seg id="1741"> Among heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhoea and human papilloma viruses are frequently occurring sexually transmitted diseases. </seg>
<seg id="1742"> The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively low; however, around 20 percent of newly contracted cases of HIV are found in this group. </seg>
<seg id="1743"> Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups. </seg>
<seg id="1744"> According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25. </seg>
<seg id="1745"> In this country, human papilloma viruses are also frequently found in young people. </seg>
<seg id="1746"> How has the number of infections developed? </seg>
<seg id="1747"> Not all sexually transmitted diseases are notifiable. </seg>
<seg id="1748"> According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001, to 3,698 cases in 2011. </seg>
<seg id="1749"> The number of newly contracted cases of HIV has been on the decline since 2007. </seg>
<seg id="1750"> In 2011 there were around 2,700 cases. </seg>
<seg id="1751"> This is around one tenth fewer than the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="1752"> Which symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease? </seg>
<seg id="1753"> The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, lower abdominal pain and blisters or warts. </seg>
<seg id="1754"> However, often they cause no pain or any other symptoms, thus remaining undetected. </seg>
<seg id="1755"> How can you protect yourself? </seg>
<seg id="1756"> Condoms can reduce the risk of contraction, however, they do not offer 100% protection. </seg>
<seg id="1757"> This is because occasionally, the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on via smear infections and close bodily contact. </seg>
<seg id="1758"> Therefore, first and foremost experts recommend that people with frequently changing sexual partners undergo regular examinations. </seg>
<seg id="1759"> If diagnosed early, the majority of STIs can be cured and long-term consequences avoided. </seg>
<seg id="1760"> Through sponsorships donations and by no means least the funds that the choir raises across the whole of Germany, the money all adds up. </seg>
<seg id="1761"> "In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, Chairperson of the association. </seg>
<seg id="1762"> In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-assured and assertive woman, manages the money from Germany. </seg>
<seg id="1763"> She makes sure that the orphans have good accommodation, for example with one of their grandmothers. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> The Gogos, as the old ladies are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> Some of them have up to 14 orphans living with them, providing them with a roof over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes punctually every day, in their school uniforms. </seg>
<seg id="1766"> Anyone who doesn't have anyone left, arrives at the shelter with Khanyisile, a single woman who earns the same salary from the association as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day. </seg>
<seg id="1767"> In addition, "Voices for Africa" has established a sewing school,built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organisation, PSI, organised for many in the village to be tested for HIV. </seg>
<seg id="1768"> This is nothing to be taken for granted, as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country, the best way of keeping things under wraps is if people are dead. </seg>
<seg id="1769"> A king with 14 wives </seg>
<seg id="1770"> "AIDS is an absolute taboo subject," said Annette Lennartz, "because it is associated with sexuality." </seg>
<seg id="1771"> This is actually strange for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives. </seg>
<seg id="1772"> The last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III., is known for his excessive lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1773"> Polygamy in place of democracy. </seg>
<seg id="1774"> Among other factors, the fact that the HIV virus has spread quickly over the past number of decades can also be attributed to this officially sanctioned lifestyle. </seg>
<seg id="1775"> Another factor is the large number of migrant workers who carry the virus across the country. </seg>
<seg id="1776"> There are free condoms on every corner, said Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used. </seg>
<seg id="1777"> The culture prescribes otherwise - flesh to flesh." </seg>
<seg id="1778"> In order to promote the cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels through Southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-esteem, which many from the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid. </seg>
<seg id="1779"> A bus full of white people, who sing songs in a black language - this degree of recognition brings not only morale and joy, but some grim-faced border soldiers even shed a few tears. </seg>
<seg id="1780"> The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their sponsor children. </seg>
<seg id="1781"> Even though you can barely find the small village on a map, it is more than well-known in the valley of the Ezulweni River. </seg>
<seg id="1782"> "Go to Esitjeni, that's where the light is," say the people there. </seg>
<seg id="1783"> And if you make the 8,733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, to visit the stomping singers in their rehearsal room, you'll see that the light is there too. </seg>
<seg id="1784"> Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury </seg>
<seg id="1785"> The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1786"> It is thought that the ice cover may be up to 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1787"> The US space agency, NASA, has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1788"> Although the planet lies closest to the sun, it does have frozen water - as shown in three studies published on Thursday in specialist magazine "Science." </seg>
<seg id="1789"> The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet that lies permanently in shadow. </seg>
<seg id="1790"> This is thought to be at east 30 centimetres and perhaps up to 20 metres thick. </seg>
<seg id="1791"> The water presumably came from comets or perhaps also asteroids that impacted with Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1792"> However, no-one is linking the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said Chief Scientist for the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon. </seg>
<seg id="1793"> The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius. </seg>
<seg id="1794"> That said, the findings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life reached other regions of the solar system. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> Unknown to the majority of the Earth's inhabitants, there are probes, telescopes and small robots such as the Phoenix, deployed to research the depths of the universe. </seg>
<seg id="1796"> From time to time, they transmit images to Earth: small peepholes into the infinite expanse. </seg>
<seg id="1797"> This image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute. </seg>
<seg id="1798"> The eight planets of our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres. </seg>
<seg id="1799"> Like Pluto, which orbits around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a planet according to the new definition of the term issued by the International Astronomical Union in 2006. </seg>
<seg id="1800"> This image section from an infrared recording by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are seen as blue dots, while more difficult to identify are the pink-coloured "new-borns" in the star delivery room. </seg>
<seg id="1801"> This star-forming region - rather unromantically named W5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the Cassiopeia constellation, at a distance of 6,500 light years away. </seg>
<seg id="1802"> This shimmering glow of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1803"> The donut-shaped ring consists of material, ejected by the star in the process of dying. </seg>
<seg id="1804"> In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light years away from the Earth, new stars are created from gas and dust. </seg>
<seg id="1805"> NASA's Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic delivery room. </seg>
<seg id="1806"> The Pleiades star cluster, also referred to as "The Seven Sisters," can be seen with the bare eye at night. </seg>
<seg id="1807"> With the telescope, however, the colours really come into their own. </seg>
<seg id="1808"> In this infrared photo, the Helix Nebula looks back at the observer like a red eye. </seg>
<seg id="1809"> It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius constellation. </seg>
<seg id="1810"> Its similarity with the continent resulted in this Nebula acquiring the title 'North America'. </seg>
<seg id="1811"> A combination of normal and infrared photography produced the spectacular colouring. </seg>
<seg id="1812"> This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty using the Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors. </seg>
<seg id="1813"> Saturn and its rings: How these occurred is the greatest puzzle in the field of astronomy. </seg>
<seg id="1814"> Perhaps they are the remnants of a moon of Saturn, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> One of the largest and sharpest pictures from the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy </seg>
<seg id="1816"> Depending on the colouring, photographs of spiral galaxies can become genuine works of art. </seg>
<seg id="1817"> The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the Sagittarius constellation, several thousand light years away. </seg>
<seg id="1818"> The name Trifid stems from the Latin word trifidus (divided into three parts), as dark stripes of dust divide the core of the birthplace of stars into three parts. </seg>
<seg id="1819"> In the Ophiuchus constellation, astronomers have photographed the signs of a cosmic collision: 400 million light years from the earth, the cores of two merging galaxies move rapidly towards one another, destined to collide. </seg>
<seg id="1820"> This star birth was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy. </seg>
<seg id="1821"> Anyone who doesn't like technical abbreviations may prefer to call it by its nickname, the Southern Catherine Wheel. </seg>
<seg id="1822"> The photo taken by the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the Cepheus constellation. </seg>
<seg id="1823"> The nebula, 1,400 light years away, consists of particles of dust that are ten to one hundred times smaller than standard house dust. </seg>
<seg id="1824"> This image was put together from the X-ray images captured by various telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1825"> It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1826"> This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, was pictured for NASA by the Hubble space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1827"> Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810. </seg>
<seg id="1828"> This star nebula is home to the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way. </seg>
<seg id="1829"> This 'star cradle' continually produces new youngsters. </seg>
<seg id="1830"> Likewise, this star cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, continually produces new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the Earth. </seg>
<seg id="1831"> In this bright shining galaxy with one small black hole, there exists no dust - only gas. </seg>
<seg id="1832"> Researchers presume that it only came into being shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was comprised primarily of hydrogen. </seg>
<seg id="1833"> Our view of the universe: the most important telescopes </seg>
<seg id="1834"> The telescope is thought to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei used the device to observe the stars one year later. </seg>
<seg id="1835"> Since then, the mirrors in optical telescopes have become increasingly large and the insights that they provide increasingly profound. </seg>
<seg id="1836"> For a period of 30 years, namely from 1947 until 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1837"> The mirror, shown in the image, had a diameter of five metres. </seg>
<seg id="1838"> Arizona, USA,is home to the Large Binocular Telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1839"> It enables views of space via two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1840"> The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canarian island of La Palma are huge - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.4 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1841"> The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to reduce costs. </seg>
<seg id="1842"> In spite of this it achieves a diameter of around eleven metres. </seg>
<seg id="1843"> The disadvantage of this inexpensive construction method: the telescope is securely clamped at its angle of inclination and its movement is therefore limited. </seg>
<seg id="1844"> The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed angle of inclination. </seg>
<seg id="1845"> What sets it apart: the high light-gathering capacity. </seg>
<seg id="1846"> This - in spite of its comparatively low mirror diameter - even matches that of the world's largest reflector telescopes. </seg>
<seg id="1847"> With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers can listen for extraterrestrial signals in space. </seg>
<seg id="1848"> The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1849"> In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) every computer owner can be of assistance, by making his/her processing capacity available. </seg>
<seg id="1850"> View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes. </seg>
<seg id="1851"> This is home to the Very Large Telescope, which lives up to its name. </seg>
<seg id="1852"> With its total of four mirrors, the telescope can also focus on the medial infrared spectrum. </seg>
<seg id="1853"> Likewise to be located at the ESO Observatory in Chile, the European Extremely Large Telescope is also being planned. </seg>
<seg id="1854"> Its main mirror is to span a full 42 metres and will be made from almost 1,000 mirror elements. </seg>
<seg id="1855"> However, images are not to be expected until 2018 at the earliest. </seg>
<seg id="1856"> Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes at the Hawaiian volcano, Mauna Kea, were the largest in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1857"> They each have two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters. </seg>
<seg id="1858"> The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside the Keck telescopes, can look to the heavens with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF. </seg>
<seg id="1859"> Another huge new telescope is also to be built on the Mauna Kea, with a mirror diameter of thirty metres. </seg>
<seg id="1860"> Here you can marvel at an artist's impression. </seg>
<seg id="1861"> However, the most important insights into space are provided by the Hubble space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1862"> Since 24 April 1990 it has been supplying images of distant worlds. </seg>
<seg id="1863"> Since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extra-solar planets, especially for any that may be inhabitable. </seg>
<seg id="1864"> On 2 February 2011 it was announced by NASA that 1,235 planetary candidates had been identified since the mission began. </seg>
<seg id="1865"> The image documents the final launch preparations on the Kepler space telescope. </seg>
<seg id="1866"> The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space on board an Ariane5 rocket by 2018 at the earliest. </seg>
<seg id="1867"> The primary mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres. </seg>
<seg id="1868"> One of the telescope's tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies that emerged after the Big Bang. </seg>
<seg id="1869"> Scientists are assuming that ice also exists at Mercury's south pole. </seg>
<seg id="1870"> However, there is no reliable data in support of this as the Messenger orbits around the planets much closer to the north pole. </seg>
<seg id="1871"> For decades, radar measurements have indicated that there is ice on Mercury. </seg>
<seg id="1872"> Thanks to the Messenger probe that was launched in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists can now be certain. </seg>
<seg id="1873"> Drink butter on a daily basis - and live to 168 years of age </seg>
<seg id="1874"> In Southern Azerbaijan, many people reach biblical ages. </seg>
<seg id="1875"> There is even a museum of longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1876"> A hunt for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still comparatively young. </seg>
<seg id="1877"> In Southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages that can almost be considered biblical. </seg>
<seg id="1878"> There is even a museum of longevity. </seg>
<seg id="1879"> A hunt for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still comparatively young. </seg>
<seg id="1880"> The journey through the Talysh Mountains can be described as wild and romantic. </seg>
<seg id="1881"> The minibus rumbles over the winding streets, past densely wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses. </seg>
<seg id="1882"> Everywhere is green and lush - you could be forgiven for thinking you were in the Black Forest. </seg>
<seg id="1883"> However, this is the deep south of Azerbaijan, and the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away. </seg>
<seg id="1884"> This is the home of the Caucasian people group, the Talysh, of whom not much is known except that they speak perfect Persian and Azeri and live long lives. </seg>
<seg id="1885"> The final stop is Lerik. </seg>
<seg id="1886"> The small town is bursting with overpowering architecture from Soviet times, which doesn't fit with the picturesque mountain landscape at all. </seg>
<seg id="1887"> Tourists from Europe rarely come here; the journey from Azerbaijan's capital city, Baku, is too arduous. </seg>
<seg id="1888"> It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres, as too much of the route is just a single track. </seg>
<seg id="1889"> The fabulous wealth, for which the country has its oil in the Caspian Sea to thank, has not yet arrives here in the province. </seg>
<seg id="1890"> Yet Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to be a tourist attraction. </seg>
<seg id="1891"> "Baku became famous in May due to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year we are having a festival to celebrate the oldest people in the world," said Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1892"> She is the Director of the Museum of Longevity, most likely the only of its kind in the world. </seg>
<seg id="1893"> Here the lives of eight dozen Talysh from the area who lived to older than 100 are documented. Fatulayeva points out a black & white photo. </seg>
<seg id="1894"> This here is my grandfather, he was 120 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1895"> At the age of 136 he fathered another child. </seg>
<seg id="1896"> However, the unrivalled star of the museum is shepherd Shirali Muslimov who is said to have lived to 168 years old. </seg>
<seg id="1897"> However no birth certificate exists to confirm this. </seg>
<seg id="1898"> And given that the longest confirmed lifespan was 122 years of age, Muslimov's claim seems extremely doubtful. </seg>
<seg id="1899"> "He was born in 1805, here in the region, and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1900"> The man married three times and had 23 children, and is said to have fathered another daughter at the age of 136. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> So did Shirali Muslimov miscalculate his age by a couple of decades? </seg>
<seg id="1902"> But Rembrandt Scholz, researcher on ageing at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of people living to impressive ages in Central Asia. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> "A strikingly high number of extremely elderly people can also be found in some areas of China, in Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," said Scholz, "while there is also an extremely large number of very old men in Sardinia." </seg>
<seg id="1904"> Due to lacking documentation, however, there is no scientific proof of age, particularly as there are no birth registers. </seg>
<seg id="1905"> Melted butter by the glass, every day </seg>
<seg id="1906"> However, the fact remains that the people of the region surrounding Lerik reach a biblical age with striking regularity. </seg>
<seg id="1907"> There are currently 20 individuals older than 100 years of age. </seg>
<seg id="1908"> So why do so many very old people live here in the south? </seg>
<seg id="1909"> The Azeri travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this as being due to the special Talysh genetics. </seg>
<seg id="1910"> In contrast, Museum Director Fatulayeva believes that it is due to diet. </seg>
<seg id="1911"> However the notion that the calorie-rich diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and of whom many drink a glass of melted butter on a daily basis, could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem plausible either. </seg>
<seg id="1912"> Or is it the traditional way of life that keeps the people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1913"> At 97 years old she is still comparatively young for the area. </seg>
<seg id="1914"> Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region. </seg>
<seg id="1915"> She sits on the floor with a butter churn, which she rolls backwards and forwards tirelessly. </seg>
<seg id="1916"> Eight people live here under this roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom have been grandparents for some time. </seg>
<seg id="1917"> There are also two small children running around. </seg>
<seg id="1918"> In the kitchen, tea is prepared for the guests, which is served in typical, bulging Armadu glasses. </seg>
<seg id="1919"> Mirzayeva's white teeth stand in perfect rank and file, beneath her headscarf she conceals long, dark blond plaits, which her son proudly reveals for us. </seg>
<seg id="1920"> I have always washed my hair with milk, and it has never fallen out or lost its colour. </seg>
<seg id="1921"> "I have never used shampoo either," said Mirzayeva. </seg>
<seg id="1922"> Monthly pension is enough to live on </seg>
<seg id="1923"> She has only ever eaten what she could get from her own farm - tomatoes, potatoes, peas. </seg>
<seg id="1924"> My whole life I have never once bought groceries in the supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="1925"> Then she tells of her husband who was in the army. </seg>
<seg id="1926"> Things were at their worst during the time after the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="1927"> However, everything became better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the rudder. </seg>
<seg id="1928"> The propaganda seems strange coming from the mouth of an old lady. </seg>
<seg id="1929"> Yet the cult that revolved around the father figure for the nation, who governed his country like a dictator practically knows no limits in Azerbaijan. </seg>
<seg id="1930"> He held power until 2003 and his son Ilham later took over the helm. </seg>
<seg id="1931"> At least there is no deprivation among Azerbaijan's elderly. </seg>
<seg id="1932"> Mirzayeva receives 230 Manat (around the same sum in euros) per month as her pension, which in a local context is an amount on which one can live comfortably. </seg>
<seg id="1933"> And perhaps Mirzayeva's long greying son is right: "The elderly enjoy a deep respect in our culture." </seg>
<seg id="1934"> They live among their extended family, are loved, cared for and are happy. </seg>
<seg id="1935"> If this is not a reason to live for as long as possible, then what is? </seg>
<seg id="1936"> The notion of "human rights" is omitted from the constitution. </seg>
<seg id="1937"> The revolution has returned to Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="1938"> Competing demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division within the country. </seg>
<seg id="1939"> The future constitution based on Sharia law is fiercely disputed. </seg>
<seg id="1940"> The Egyptian President is not holding back his emotion. </seg>
<seg id="1941"> We must make the transition. </seg>
<seg id="1942"> "And making sure it succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television. </seg>
<seg id="1943"> His speech was aimed at the entire population,however in particular at the Coptic Christians, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists. </seg>
<seg id="1944"> For all of them, until now hopelessly estranged in a bewildered opposition, are fearful. </seg>
<seg id="1945"> They are fearful of a God State on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. </seg>
<seg id="1946"> According to Mohamed Mursi, speaking almost apologetically, he has temporarily restricted the authority of the constitutional court and increased his own authority, "in order to rescue the revolution." </seg>
<seg id="1947"> However, Egyptians - and the world - are not entirely sure what the 61-year-old engineer who holds a Doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save. </seg>
<seg id="1948"> Should the judiciary be deprived of power? </seg>
<seg id="1949"> In actual fact, the 234 articles, which have been pushed through by the Islamic-dominated 110-person Constituent Assembly, are in some aspects cause for concern. </seg>
<seg id="1950"> As was also the case under previous constitutions, under the draft judicature is justified on the "principles of Islamic law." </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Yet what are "principles"? </seg>
<seg id="1952"> This was and remains subject to interpretation and there is concern that the Islamists will make use of the woolly formulation and the resulting room for legal manoeuvre in favour of a stricter interpretation of Sharia law. </seg>
<seg id="1953"> This is at least suggested by one newly added article: in all issues affecting Sharia law, the Al Ashar University must be consulted, the country's most important Islamic institution, which has great influence throughout the whole of Sunni Islam. </seg>
<seg id="1954"> This can, but does not necessarily have to mean that the clergy will oversee legislation, which would result in the de facto incapacitation of the judiciary. </seg>
<seg id="1955"> Much in the constitutional draft is open to interpretation </seg>
<seg id="1956"> Also problematic: civil military jurisdiction will continue to be upheld. </seg>
<seg id="1957"> During Mubarak's rule, these courts served to suppress opposition. </seg>
<seg id="1958"> Following the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were under military imprisonment. </seg>
<seg id="1959"> According to the draft, the state should also protect "the true character of the Egyptian family, and promote its morals and values." </seg>
<seg id="1960"> From a legal perspective, this is formulated in such an unclear manner that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of cinematic art and literature. </seg>
<seg id="1961"> In plain language, this is nothing other than censorship. </seg>
<seg id="1962"> Incidentally, no article explicitly establishes the equality of men and women. </seg>
<seg id="1963"> Another does prohibit the insult or slander of the prophet Mohamed and his emissaries. </seg>
<seg id="1964"> However, what constitutes an insult and how this should be sanctioned remains unclear. </seg>
<seg id="1965"> Equally dubious is the formulation stating that "insulting people" is forbidden. </seg>
<seg id="1966"> Is a caricature of the president sufficient, or a joke at the expense of a jurist? </seg>
<seg id="1967"> Open to interpretation, like so much in the draft submitted by Mursi to be signed and that, in his own words, will be submitted to Egyptians for referendum "very soon." </seg>
<seg id="1968"> "The revolution is back" </seg>
<seg id="1969"> For weeks the opposition has been gathering to combat the superior strength of the Islamists. </seg>
<seg id="1970"> Tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at the Tahrir Square in Cairo, in unfamiliar unity, and pledged to bring down the charter before it has even come into effect. </seg>
<seg id="1971"> "The revolution is back and we are going to be victorious," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third place candidate in the presidential elections. </seg>
<seg id="1972"> Noble Peace Prize winner and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Authority, Mohamed El-Baradei explained that the constitutional draft belongs "on the rubbish tip of history." </seg>
<seg id="1973"> Via SMS service Twitter, he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead "a coup against democracy." </seg>
<seg id="1974"> "If he calls for the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said member of the opposition Jasser Said. </seg>
<seg id="1975"> "We have not yet grown tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," stated the Egyptian media, quoting opposition politician Chaled Ali. </seg>
<seg id="1976"> And several judges have signalled that they do not want to oversee the referendum, which would render it invalid. </seg>
<seg id="1977"> "The Koran is our constitution" </seg>
<seg id="1978"> The well-organised Muslim Brotherhood gathered for a counter-demonstration, although acting cautiously they did not choose the Tahrir Square but rather a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile, outside the Cairo University. </seg>
<seg id="1979"> Many veiled women and followers of the Salafis took part, shouting out: "The people demand the application of God's law." </seg>
<seg id="1980"> They demanded of Mursi: "Cleanse the country!" and protested: "The Koran is our constitution." </seg>
<seg id="1981"> A struggle for control over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have most likely provoked events verging on civil war. </seg>
<seg id="1982"> Quite clearly, this was something that Mursi's followers did not want to risk. </seg>
<seg id="1983"> The Muslim Brothers stated that both those against and those in favour of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves loud and clear. </seg>
<seg id="1984"> Now is the time to let the population decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should move forward. </seg>
<seg id="1985"> It is a certainty that there is a majority in favour of the Islamists' draft. </seg>
<seg id="1986"> "The term 'human rights' does not even appear once" </seg>
<seg id="1987"> Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutive process, which actually should have lasted until February and should have involved all social interest groups. </seg>
<seg id="1988"> The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, when imprisoned or in court under Mubarak. </seg>
<seg id="1989"> Not because he shared their world view, but because for him, human rights are indivisible. </seg>
<seg id="1990"> For this he was battered, condemned and imprisoned. </seg>
<seg id="1991"> "And now the term human rights does not even appear once in the new constitution," he bemoaned in a discussion with "Welt am Sonntag." </seg>
<seg id="1992"> The lawyer has resigned himself to Mursi extending his power to all three branches of state government. </seg>
<seg id="1993"> These measures are blatant breaches of the ground rules of democracy and will guide Egypt into a new dictatorship. </seg>
<seg id="1994"> "Instead of strengthening the civil society, the President is effectively suspending it," complained Saeda. </seg>
<seg id="1995"> Yet without civil society organisations, a democracy cannot function. </seg>
<seg id="1996"> Saeda feels abandoned,even by the international community, which is observing the battle over the ideological direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement. </seg>
<seg id="1997"> This could come back to haunt them. </seg>
<seg id="1998"> One demonstrator at the Tahrir warned: "You are letting loose a monster that you can no longer control." </seg>
<seg id="1999"> Norway's rakfisk: Is this the world's smelliest fish? </seg>
<seg id="2000"> Norway's five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not just in Europe, but in the world. </seg>
<seg id="2001"> Could the secret of the country's success be connected to the local appetite for some exceedingly smelly fish? </seg>
<seg id="2002"> Take a selection of over-ripe cheeses. </seg>
<seg id="2003"> Place them in the midst of a pile of dirty, wet soccer kit. </seg>
<seg id="2004"> Leave for a week. </seg>
<seg id="2005"> Now you have the nose-numbing smell of rakfisk, one of the great Norwegian delicacies. </seg>
<seg id="2006"> I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="2007"> There is snow, spectacular scenery - and that odour, ever present, hangs in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2008"> Rakfisk is trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for - depending on how smelly you like your fish - up to a year. </seg>
<seg id="2009"> As the dark sets in and the weather turns cold, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes devoted to this most, well, captivating of foods. </seg>
<seg id="2010"> "You eat it raw, and then swallow a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, full-time local firefighter but also the so-called "Rakfisk General," in charge of running the festival. </seg>
<seg id="2011"> All around us people are eating little cubes of the fish and knocking back quantities of drink. </seg>
<seg id="2012"> "Some people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk," says Havard. </seg>
<seg id="2013"> The drink can kill the smell. </seg>
<seg id="2014"> I try a few pieces. </seg>
<seg id="2015"> If you can avoid passing it under your nose, it is not bad - not unlike a slice of sushi that has been on rather a long bus journey. </seg>
<seg id="2016"> Rakfisk is a product of very different, poverty-stricken times in Norway when, pre-refrigeration, fish was soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in autumn. </seg>
<seg id="2017"> Then in the depths of winter, well and truly fermented, it is taken out and - no doubt with the senses knocked out by alcohol - eaten. </seg>
<seg id="2018"> Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, emigrating mainly to the US. </seg>
<seg id="2019"> Now the population is expanding fast - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by plentiful jobs, high wages and a comprehensive care system. </seg>
<seg id="2020"> People from Sweden, the old rival and not so long ago far richer than Norway, stream in to work. </seg>
<seg id="2021"> Rakfisk is seen as signifying something important, a vital if rather smelly part of Norway's past. </seg>
<seg id="2022"> It is among the more expensive dishes you can buy. </seg>
<seg id="2023"> But then everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich knock you back £9 ($14) each. </seg>
<seg id="2024"> Norway does not often make it on to the global news agenda - and most seem to like it that way. </seg>
<seg id="2025"> People here are still loath to mention by name Anders Breivik, the right-wing, racist extremist who gunned down and killed 77 men, women and children last year. </seg>
<seg id="2026"> Instead, the shootings are referred to as "the July the 22nd incident." </seg>
<seg id="2027"> Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their own was capable of such brutality and murder. </seg>
<seg id="2028"> The growth since the early 1970s of one of the world's biggest oil and gas industries lies behind much of Norway's present-day wealth. </seg>
<seg id="2029"> "But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well," says Anna our waitress, handing round trays of maturing rakfisk and, with her long blond hair and startlingly blue eyes, the image of Nordic well-being. </seg>
<seg id="2030"> We are a - how you say - prudent people. </seg>
<seg id="2031"> Her English, like that of most people here, is flawless. </seg>
<seg id="2032"> We are not very showy, we do not like ostentation. </seg>
<seg id="2033"> Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations. </seg>
<seg id="2034"> When everyone else was throwing around money they did not have, in the years leading up to the global financial crash, Norway kept its purse strings tightly bound. </seg>
<seg id="2035"> "As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer we are happy," says Anna. </seg>
<seg id="2036"> "And eat rakfisk," she adds with a carefree laugh. </seg>
<seg id="2037"> I stand in the snow and queue for something to eat - I have had enough rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2038"> Now an elk burger is certainly something different and rather succulent to the taste. </seg>
<seg id="2039"> But in the evening, it is more of that smelly fish. </seg>
<seg id="2040"> The hotel I am staying in is one of a number of venues hosting a rakfisk dinner where guests vote on the best - or perhaps the most nasally challenging - fish. </seg>
<seg id="2041"> There is a live TV link up to a compere in a bow tie surrounded by plates of rakfisk. </seg>
<seg id="2042"> It is like the Eurovision song contest. </seg>
<seg id="2043"> "What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains Thor-Juergen?" </seg>
<seg id="2044"> "Here are our points, Havard." </seg>
<seg id="2045"> There is clapping, laughter. </seg>
<seg id="2046"> A man falls off his chair, perhaps overcome with aquavit. </seg>
<seg id="2047"> Or maybe it is the fumes from all that fish. </seg>
<seg id="2048"> Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces tough start </seg>
<seg id="2049"> As Mexico's incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC's Will Grant looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population. </seg>
<seg id="2050"> Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present. </seg>
<seg id="2051"> A congested city at the best of times, a ring of steel has been erected since Monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="2052"> The aim, however, wasn't to stop commuters getting to work but prevent protesters from reaching parliament. </seg>
<seg id="2053"> On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential sash and take over the running of the nation. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> He faces a complicated task. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> Mexico has been performing well economically under the outgoing administration of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> "My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence," Mr Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> I will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve that aim. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> Before rubbing shoulders with the US president, Mr Pena Nieto's previous political experience was as governor of his home state, the State of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> A populous, sprawling state surrounding the capital, opinions about the new leader are divided in his old stomping ground. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> A straightforward man </seg>
<seg id="2061"> In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered fondly. </seg>
<seg id="2062"> Residents credit him with boosting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> To reach the town you can drive along one of Mr Pena Nieto's new motorways, a vast improvement on the cracked and bumpy roads it replaced. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> Plaques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum about climate change. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> "We are looking to him to bring about real and lasting change," says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman for Mr Pena Nieto's party, the PRI. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> Particularly in terms of security and the economy, we're hoping for an interesting and true change which our country so badly needs. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> After an unbroken 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there is much expectation within the party about Enrique Pena Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> And he rejects the opposition's characterisation of the new president as lacking substance. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> He's a very straightforward man, very committed with an excellent vision of the country. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> He's an excellent statesman and, above all, he's someone who knows how to listen. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> But on the other side of the state, that is not the impression many people have of their former governor. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo couldn't be sharper. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> Tucked away under motorway flyovers, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> And the problems in the municipality are also gritty and urban. </seg>
<seg id="2076"> Earlier this year, the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is particularly acute. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> On a patch of wasteland by a vast landfill site, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped over the past two years alone. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr Pena Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> Mr Pena Nieto's critics say, at best, he failed to adequately address the problem of femicide while he was in office. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> At worst, they accuse his administration of turning a blind eye. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> In a concrete home typical of the rundown neighbourhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to fight back the tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter, Mariana Luna. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> However her family believes she was murdered by her partner. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> "When I arrived at her house it seemed her body had been washed," Senora Buendia recalls. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> There were signs she'd been beaten, and rigor mortis had already set in. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> As her mother recounts the story, a picture of Mariana looks down from the walls, next to a cross bearing a single word: Justice. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> However, that is exactly what the family say they have been denied. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> The state authorities have treated me like I'm an old gossip, a trouble-maker, a whiner. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and shuts up. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> "But that can't be right when there were so many irregularities and omissions," she says. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> As President Pena Nieto receives the sash on Saturday, it comes with a heavy responsibility. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> "I hope he's the same kind of president as he was a governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> That, however, is exactly what victims' families in Ciudad Neza most fear. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> Bradley Manning didn't complain about mistreatment, prosecutors contend </seg>
<seg id="2096"> Prosecutors try to counter Bradley Manning's claims of abuse in confinement </seg>
<seg id="2097"> The hearing focuses on Manning's time in the military brig at Quantico, Virginia </seg>
<seg id="2098"> Defense wants case dismissed on grounds that Manning's confinement was harsh </seg>
<seg id="2099"> The Army private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents </seg>
<seg id="2100"> Prosecutors tried to establish Friday that Army private Bradley Manning -- charged in the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history -- missed multiple opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he's alleging he suffered in military custody. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> While cross-examining Manning at a pre-trial hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein asserted that records of weekly visits Manning had with unit officers during nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about his treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2102"> The cross-examination -- during a hearing on a defense motion to have Manning's case dismissed on grounds that his confinement has been harsh and has amounted to enough punishment -- came a day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide while in custody. </seg>
<seg id="2103"> The Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="2104"> The material was then published online by WikiLeaks. </seg>
<seg id="2105"> WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information. </seg>
<seg id="2106"> In Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Manning during his detention at Quantico's brig, where he was held under a heightened confinement status from July 2010 to April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2107"> Officers would ask Manning questions and write down his responses. </seg>
<seg id="2108"> When Fein asked about the forms Friday, Manning acknowledged that he rated treatment by his guards as "excellent" and treatment by the facility overall as "very professional." </seg>
<seg id="2109"> The forms show no complaints of mistreatment, even though the officers asked Manning directly about his treatment, Fein contended. </seg>
<seg id="2110"> Manning responded that he would verbally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed, but they didn't record the issues. </seg>
<seg id="2111"> "They would write down 'no issues' (after discussing the concerns), and it didn't necessarily mean I didn't bring something up," Manning said. </seg>
<seg id="2112"> The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he didn't complain about his treatment during a January 2011 meeting with a board examining the suicidal thoughts he expressed in a form months earlier. </seg>
<seg id="2113"> Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to get his "prevention of injury" status downgraded. </seg>
<seg id="2114"> The military said they put him on this restrictive status -- a step below suicide watch -- for his protection and the safety of others. </seg>
<seg id="2115"> "I wanted staff to know I was fine, and (I wanted to) get off the POI status ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my viewpoint," Manning said. </seg>
<seg id="2116"> Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the brig at Marine Base Quantico in Virginia in July 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2117"> He said he contemplated suicide in Kuwait and once passed out there due to the heat. </seg>
<seg id="2118"> He said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was distressing. </seg>
<seg id="2119"> "My world just shrink to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning said Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="2120"> I thought I was going to die in that cage. </seg>
<seg id="2121"> Once at Quantico, Manning said, he spend most days in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours -- with no company. </seg>
<seg id="2122"> Manning said he was allowed only a mattress, blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses. </seg>
<seg id="2123"> He said he tried to keep moving, because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules. </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Manning said he always slept with light from outside his cell in his eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2125"> If guards could not see his face when he rolled over at night, he said they would wake him to roll back over. </seg>
<seg id="2126"> Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to Manning's treatment in January 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2127"> Manning was moved to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011. </seg>
<seg id="2128"> Also Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation that he made in Thursday's testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Quantico cell, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates during a morning head count. </seg>
<seg id="2129"> Manning had testified that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blanket during the head count. </seg>
<seg id="2130"> Under questioning from the judge Friday, Manning said that he inferred from his guard's order that he should drop a blanket that could have covered him, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it. </seg>
<seg id="2131"> Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show an officer that he wasn't a danger to himself. </seg>
<seg id="2132"> Manning said that he told the officer that he could have used the waistband of his underwear or his flip-flops to hurt himself but hadn't done so. </seg>
<seg id="2133"> That night, Manning testified, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell. </seg>
<seg id="2134"> His lawyers hope the judge will at least take his experiences during confinement into account and sharply reduce his sentence should he be convicted at his court-martial, which is expected to begin early next year. </seg>
<seg id="2135"> The defense has said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to lesser offenses and fight other charges as being too extreme. </seg>
<seg id="2136"> The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend, with prosecutors expected to argue that the detention conditions were warranted. </seg>
<seg id="2137"> The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with rules governing all maximum-custody detainees at Quantico. </seg>
<seg id="2138"> Counts against Manning include aiding the enemy, wrongfully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or records. </seg>
<seg id="2139"> If he's convicted on all counts, he could face a life sentence. </seg>
<seg id="2140"> My Mexican-American identity crisis </seg>
<seg id="2141"> He says many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there </seg>
<seg id="2142"> Mexicans tend to fault those who left; they remind Mexicans of hard times, he says </seg>
<seg id="2143"> Navarrette says Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds </seg>
<seg id="2144"> On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had barely made my way down the concourse and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got stumped. </seg>
<seg id="2145"> Signs pointed the way to two lines: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners.") </seg>
<seg id="2146"> I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of where to go. </seg>
<seg id="2147"> Growing up in Central California, I had been called a "Mexican" my entire life. </seg>
<seg id="2148"> It's ethnic shorthand in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York describe themselves as "Italian." </seg>
<seg id="2149"> Later, I settled on "Mexican-American." </seg>
<seg id="2150"> But, this was Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2151"> And, in the homeland of my grandfather, there was no need for shorthand or hyphens. </seg>
<seg id="2152"> I was simply an American. </seg>
<seg id="2153"> I speak Spanish, good enough to handle either end of an interview in that language. </seg>
<seg id="2154"> But I don't have the vocabulary of a native, and I can't shake my American accent. </seg>
<seg id="2155"> So I took my U.S. passport and got in the line for Extranjeros. </seg>
<seg id="2156"> I thought about that moment this week when Mexican president-elect Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama. </seg>
<seg id="2157"> On the agenda, as usual, when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade. </seg>
<seg id="2158"> Pena Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason that Mexicans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2159"> He wants to partner with the United States and Canada, and create a European Union-style trading bloc in North America. </seg>
<seg id="2160"> And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico's war against the drug cartels, even though he offered no specifics. </seg>
<seg id="2161"> For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with hard feelings. </seg>
<seg id="2162"> Most Americans probably never give a thought to the fact that, in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of rifle. </seg>
<seg id="2163"> But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, the reminders are everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="2164"> So the minute that a U.S. official says anything the least bit critical of Mexico, you start hearing -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how the Americans are encroaching upon their neighbor's sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2165"> And the children of Montezuma go on the warpath. </seg>
<seg id="2166"> And yet, for Mexico, the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2167"> You want to talk about hard feelings? </seg>
<seg id="2168"> There is plenty. </seg>
<seg id="2169"> Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it doesn't. </seg>
<seg id="2170"> The only reason you have so many people of Mexican ancestry living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe a parent or grandparent, who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north. </seg>
<seg id="2171"> And more often than not, that person fit a profile -- dark skin, little education, from a poor village, etc. </seg>
<seg id="2172"> We're their offspring, and we're loyal to them. </seg>
<seg id="2173"> Not Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2174"> And even though we may now be living the American Dream, having gone to good schools and taken good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that it's the American Dream we're living, and not the Mexican one. </seg>
<seg id="2175"> Our identity might sometimes be fuzzy, but our loyalty is clear. </seg>
<seg id="2176"> It's to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2177"> Besides, we're aware that many of the elite Mexicans in the ruling class don't like us. </seg>
<seg id="2178"> The feeling is mutual. </seg>
<seg id="2179"> They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us as inferior stock that isn't sufficiently Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2180"> Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough. </seg>
<seg id="2181"> Our existence is, as they see it, all about failure. </seg>
<seg id="2182"> If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left. </seg>
<seg id="2183"> And we wouldn't now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain, living well in the United States but lost souls nonetheless. </seg>
<seg id="2184"> My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because Mexicans have a firmer grasp of who they are and Mexican-Americans resent that. </seg>
<seg id="2185"> While she's a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as a part of two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2186"> Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know don't feel like they're a part of either. </seg>
<seg id="2187"> We love listening to the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen. </seg>
<seg id="2188"> You get the best of both worlds, but you're rooted in neither. </seg>
<seg id="2189"> In Mexico, we're seen as Americans. </seg>
<seg id="2190"> And in the United States, we're considered Mexican. </seg>
<seg id="2191"> Now, to complicate the relationship even further, as I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and parts of the intelligentsia want to reconnect with the Diaspora. </seg>
<seg id="2192"> They want to put Mexican-Americans to work as makeshift "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing its interest in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2193"> We would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2194"> Yeah. </seg>
<seg id="2195"> That's not going to happen. </seg>
<seg id="2196"> Too many hard feelings. </seg>
<seg id="2197"> And, with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a great country. </seg>
<seg id="2198"> I'm afraid you're on your own, amigos. </seg>
<seg id="2199"> That's fair. </seg>
<seg id="2200"> If at least some Mexicans aren't yet ready to forgive the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans still hold a grudge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that. </seg>
<seg id="2201"> Hmmm. </seg>
<seg id="2202"> Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought. </seg>
<seg id="2203"> Old battles, new Middle East </seg>
<seg id="2204"> The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace </seg>
<seg id="2205"> Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? </seg>
<seg id="2206"> Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such hope is vain. </seg>
<seg id="2207"> Amid the usual futile arguments over who started it, scores of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2208"> But though the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict, all around them the Middle East is changing. </seg>
<seg id="2209"> The Arab spring has thrown the pieces up in the air, and, like it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in the regional turmoil. </seg>
<seg id="2210"> Maybe this will make their struggle bloodier than before. </seg>
<seg id="2211"> However, there are reasons for thinking it could just break their lethal stalemate. </seg>
<seg id="2212"> A war that is neither lost or won </seg>
<seg id="2213"> At first sight, optimism looks very hard to justify now. </seg>
<seg id="2214"> Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st holds, this week's fighting has strengthened the hawks on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="2215"> The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to back off, even though Gaza has taken a drubbing. </seg>
<seg id="2216"> Despite killing some of its leaders and bottling up Gaza's 1.7m people in one of the most wretched and crowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2217"> Indeed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank, the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter rivals in Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction. </seg>
<seg id="2218"> Moreover, Hamas's leaders may well conclude that time is on their side. </seg>
<seg id="2219"> As Islamists across the Arab world have gained clout, so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends. </seg>
<seg id="2220"> Turkey, a resurgent regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken up Hamas's cause; so has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic of the Gulf states. </seg>
<seg id="2221"> Jubilant Hamas people say an Islamist crescent is curving around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hizbullah party-cum-militia holds sway, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist bent may topple Bashar Assad, and on down through Jordan, where Hamas's allies are menacing the king. </seg>
<seg id="2222"> Above all, on Israel's southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal of Arab countries, has changed the region's balance. </seg>
<seg id="2223"> Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his downfall in 2011, had little time for Hamas. </seg>
<seg id="2224"> By contrast, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion. </seg>
<seg id="2225"> In future diplomacy Hamas may emerge as an actor that cannot be shut out even by Israel and America. </seg>
<seg id="2226"> Meanwhile, Israel's hardliners will draw the opposite conclusions. </seg>
<seg id="2227"> In military terms, Hamas has been put back in its box. </seg>
<seg id="2228"> Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proved its worth and many of Hamas's missiles have been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="2229"> Israelis will sleep more soundly - for a while. </seg>
<seg id="2230"> In diplomatic terms, America is as steadfast as ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence. </seg>
<seg id="2231"> Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process. </seg>
<seg id="2232"> Although rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been fairly free of suicide-bombers, thanks in part to the barrier that bites into the West Bank, the main chunk of a would-be Palestinian state, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law. </seg>
<seg id="2233"> Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with an even more hawkish lot under Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to an election on January 22nd, is sitting pretty. </seg>
<seg id="2234"> Why coddle those twisty Palestinians by giving them a state of their own? </seg>
<seg id="2235"> If they really ran the West Bank, would they not fire rockets, just as their compatriots have done in Gaza? </seg>
<seg id="2236"> Better to keep them behind that wall and smite them if they raise their heads. </seg>
<seg id="2237"> Maybe the hardliners will win out; yet the Arab spring may change their calculations. </seg>
<seg id="2238"> Even if the Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel, their priority will be tackling difficulties at home. </seg>
<seg id="2239"> Israel's defence budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined. </seg>
<seg id="2240"> Starting a war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments mend their economies. </seg>
<seg id="2241"> That the pragmatic Mr Morsi worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire augurs well - and might just mark the start of something. </seg>
<seg id="2242"> Israelis too should look to the longer term. </seg>
<seg id="2243"> With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is creating a powder keg that is bound one day to explode in the territories occupied by Israel - much as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week. </seg>
<seg id="2244"> Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this as the Arab population swells. </seg>
<seg id="2245"> Bloody missions against Gaza every few years to knock back Hamas will exact a growing diplomatic toll. </seg>
<seg id="2246"> Both sides need prodding by outsiders </seg>
<seg id="2247"> The answer remains the one trumpeted by sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states, with Israel ceding territory for security. </seg>
<seg id="2248"> The hope - a small one in the short term - is that the ceasefire will give a little more leverage to outsiders pushing that cause. </seg>
<seg id="2249"> Egypt, which must now set about stopping the flow of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 boundaries with land swaps and a shared Jerusalem. </seg>
<seg id="2250"> Arab outsiders should also press Hamas and Fatah to come together. </seg>
<seg id="2251"> That would do more to create a Palestinian state than the imminent bid for virtual statehood at the UN. </seg>
<seg id="2252"> Mr Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table. </seg>
<seg id="2253"> During his first term, he neglected to present his own plan for peace. </seg>
<seg id="2254"> Back in the White House, he is looking just as reluctant to be drawn in. </seg>
<seg id="2255"> This is woefully short-sighted. </seg>
<seg id="2256"> America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East. </seg>
<seg id="2257"> That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. </seg>
<seg id="2258"> Cigarette plain packaging laws come into force in Australia </seg>
<seg id="2259"> Smoking warnings and diseased body parts emblazoned on dull green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands </seg>
<seg id="2260"> Australia's world-first laws on cigarette and tobacco plain packaging have come into force, replacing brand logos and colours with generic drab olive green coverings, gruesome pictures of diseased body parts and depictions of children and babies made ill by their parents' smoking. </seg>
<seg id="2261"> Apart from the varying health warnings and images the only difference between the packs, mandatory from Saturday, are the brand names, and these are all printed in identical small font. </seg>
<seg id="2262"> It is the world's most strict regime for the packaging of tobacco. </seg>
<seg id="2263"> Australia's federal government says the aim is to deter young people from smoking by stripping the habit of glamour. </seg>
<seg id="2264"> It is relying on studies showing that if people have not started smoking by age 26 there is a 99% chance they will never take it up. </seg>
<seg id="2265"> "Even from a very early age you can see that kids understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their branding," said the federal health minister, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, children linking a crown in a logo with the idea of being a princess. </seg>
<seg id="2266"> While Australia has one of the world's lowest smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on multinationals' profits, other countries are considering similar steps. </seg>
<seg id="2267"> The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the laws. </seg>
<seg id="2268"> Tobacco firms said they would boost black market trade, leading to cheaper, more accessible cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id="2269"> "There will be serious unintended consequences from the legislation," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2270"> Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring lots more of these products down to sell on the streets of Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2271"> Others say the laws have boosted their business. </seg>
<seg id="2272"> Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said demand for cigarette cases, silicon covers to mask the unpalatable packages, had shot up from almost nothing two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the laws in Australia's high court. </seg>
<seg id="2273"> Ha said Zico had sold up to 6,000 to wholesale outlets and was awaiting new stock. </seg>
<seg id="2274"> This is good business for us. </seg>
<seg id="2275"> The potential hitch, experts say, is the popularity of social media with the very demographic the plan is targeting. </seg>
<seg id="2276"> After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising and sports sponsorship and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from view, tobacco marketing has moved online. </seg>
<seg id="2277"> Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites but cannot restrict overseas sites. </seg>
<seg id="2278"> "If you are a tobacco marketer and you've only got this small window left to promote your products, online is the compelling place for you to be in," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University. </seg>
<seg id="2279"> Freeman noted an increase in "average Joe" reviews of brands on social media sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="2280"> We have to ask, is that just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and they've gone to the trouble of making a video, or is there a marketing company involved? </seg>
<seg id="2281"> British American Tobacco Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing. </seg>
<seg id="2282"> The industry has gone as far as paying for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - the countries are claiming at the World Trade Organisation that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite none of the countries having significant trade with Australia. </seg>
<seg id="2283"> A WTO ruling is likely in mid-2013. </seg>
<seg id="2284"> Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries considering similar laws on packaging. </seg>
<seg id="2285"> Canada was the first country to make photograph warnings mandatory in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="2286"> They now extend to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="2287"> Tougher laws are being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India. </seg>
<seg id="2288"> Many smokers in Australia remain defiant. </seg>
<seg id="2289"> The pictures don't affect me. </seg>
<seg id="2290"> I just ignore them. </seg>
<seg id="2291"> "You just grab a smoke and put it away," said Victor El Hage as he purchased a pack with a photograph of a mouth tumour. </seg>
<seg id="2292"> Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl. </seg>
<seg id="2293"> James Yu, who runs the King of the Pack tobacconist in central Sydney, said the uniform packaging made it harder to stack his shelves </seg>
<seg id="2294"> "It used to take me an hour to unload a delivery, now it takes me four hours," Yu said. </seg>
<seg id="2295"> "The government should have just banned them altogether and then we'd go OK, fine, we're done, we'll shut up shop," he said, throwing his hands up in the air. </seg>
<seg id="2296"> In a Constantly Plugged-In World, It's Not All Bad to Be Bored </seg>
<seg id="2297"> I spent five unexpected hours in an airport this Thanksgiving holiday when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive. </seg>
<seg id="2298"> So I had plenty of time to think about the subject of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2299"> I won't lie to you. </seg>
<seg id="2300"> Half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty tedious, even with the distractions of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shopping). </seg>
<seg id="2301"> But increasingly, some academics and child development experts are coming out in praise of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2302"> It's all right for us - and our children - to be bored on occasion, they say. </seg>
<seg id="2303"> It forces the brain to go on interesting tangents, perhaps fostering creativity. </seg>
<seg id="2304"> And because most of us are almost consistently plugged into one screen or another these days, we don't experience the benefits of boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2305"> So should we embrace boredom? </seg>
<seg id="2306"> Yes. </seg>
<seg id="2307"> And no. </seg>
<seg id="2308"> But I'll get back to that. </seg>
<seg id="2309"> First of all, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively recent phenomenon, with the advent of more leisure time. </seg>
<seg id="2310"> Not so, says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and the author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011). </seg>
<seg id="2311"> "Boredom actually has a very long history," he said. </seg>
<seg id="2312"> There's Latin graffiti about boredom on the walls of Pompeii dating from the first century. </seg>
<seg id="2313"> Then there's the question of how we define boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2314"> The trouble is that it has been defined, and discussed, in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada. </seg>
<seg id="2315"> After looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "wanting to, but being unable to engage in satisfying activity." </seg>
<seg id="2316"> What separates boredom from apathy, he said, is that the person is not engaged but wants to be. </seg>
<seg id="2317"> With apathy, he said, there is no urge to do something. </seg>
<seg id="2318"> The core experience of boredom, he said, is "disruption of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a sense that time is passing slowly." </seg>
<seg id="2319"> Boredom can sound an awful lot like depression. </seg>
<seg id="2320"> But Professor Eastwood said that while they can be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem as themselves. </seg>
<seg id="2321"> Sometimes we think we're bored when we just have difficulty concentrating. </seg>
<seg id="2322"> In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which appeared in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article. </seg>
<seg id="2323"> Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it at a low level so it was barely noticeable, while the third group didn't hear the soundtrack at all. </seg>
<seg id="2324"> The ones who heard the low-level TV reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating but were not sure why, and attributed that difficulty to boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2325"> When you're trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task, disruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. </seg>
<seg id="2326"> On the other hand, when you're doing something dull, "such as looking for bad widgets on a factory line, distracting music can help you not be bored." </seg>
<seg id="2327"> In fact, he said, we now know that squirming and doodling, often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it by keeping people more physically alert. </seg>
<seg id="2328"> "Research shows that kids who are allowed to fidget learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske said. </seg>
<seg id="2329"> We all experience boredom at some points - my flight delay, a droning speaker, a particularly tedious movie. </seg>
<seg id="2330"> But some individuals are more likely to be bored than others. </seg>
<seg id="2331"> To help measure this, researchers developed a "Boredom Proneness Scale" in the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="2332"> The scale includes questions like, "Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests, I don't have time to do everything." </seg>
<seg id="2333"> Using such scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes needing more, and a variety of, external stimulation. </seg>
<seg id="2334"> But in general, teenagers are a pretty jaded lot. </seg>
<seg id="2335"> In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day by beeper. </seg>
<seg id="2336"> He found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't in school. </seg>
<seg id="2337"> On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored. </seg>
<seg id="2338"> Professor Larson said he did not know whether the boredom percentages now, 21 years later, would be higher or lower. </seg>
<seg id="2339"> But he said he did know that "adolescence is a peak period for boredom," largely because children and teenagers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do. </seg>
<seg id="2340"> So back to my original question: Is boredom good for you? </seg>
<seg id="2341"> Sometimes no, because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble or indulge in substance abuse as a way to ease it, research shows. </seg>
<seg id="2342"> On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the issue for more than two decades. </seg>
<seg id="2343"> "Boredom is the brain's way to tell you you should be doing something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at N.Y.U. </seg>
<seg id="2344"> But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing to do. </seg>
<seg id="2345"> If you're bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy. </seg>
<seg id="2346"> But if you watch TV, it may make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term. </seg>
<seg id="2347"> So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he hasn't learned how to entertain himself, or self regulate, Professor Fenske said. </seg>
<seg id="2348"> And "that self-regulation transfers from one situation to other," he said. </seg>
<seg id="2349"> Your kid doesn't just learn to entertain himself, but gets more self-control in other areas. </seg>
<seg id="2350"> I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom. </seg>
<seg id="2351"> Nor should we be too critical of it. </seg>
<seg id="2352"> Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant chatter of activity and technology. </seg>
<seg id="2353"> Professor Eastwood agreed. </seg>
<seg id="2354"> "We frame it as we need to be bored more, but boredom is an agonizing, restless desire to be connected with something meaningful," he said. </seg>
<seg id="2355"> What people are really searching for, he said, is a way to unplug and enjoy down time. </seg>
<seg id="2356"> "In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to engage when the noise shuts down." </seg>
<seg id="2357"> In Colorado, No Playbook for New Marijuana Law </seg>
<seg id="2358"> Anthony Orozco, 19, a community college student and soccer player in southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across this state: the possession of a few nuggets of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it. </seg>
<seg id="2359"> Mr. Orozco said that one day in September he and a few friends were driving in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when they were pulled over. </seg>
<seg id="2360"> After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for possession and drug paraphernalia - petty offenses that each carry a $100 fine - and given a court date. </seg>
<seg id="2361"> "We get treated like criminals," Mr. Orozco said. </seg>
<seg id="2362"> But is he one? </seg>
<seg id="2363"> In the uncertain weeks after Colorado's vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location. </seg>
<seg id="2364"> Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State, which approved a similar measure. </seg>
<seg id="2365"> Police departments have stopped charging adults 21 years and older for small-scale possession that will be legally sanctioned once the laws take effect in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="2366"> But prosecutors in more conservative precincts in Colorado have vowed to press ahead with existing marijuana cases and are still citing people for possession. </seg>
<seg id="2367"> At the same time, several towns from the Denver suburbs to the Western mountains are voting to block new, state-licensed retail marijuana shops from opening in their communities. </seg>
<seg id="2368"> "This thing is evolving so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver. </seg>
<seg id="2369"> Regulators in Washington State are also scratching their heads. </seg>
<seg id="2370"> And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licenses for production, manufacturing, distribution and sales - all by a deadline of Dec. 1, 2013. </seg>
<seg id="2371"> They say that Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now recreationally. </seg>
<seg id="2372"> "Colorado has a more regulated market, so they will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board. </seg>
<seg id="2373"> But no place or system, Mr. Smith conceded, can do more than suggest what might work. </seg>
<seg id="2374"> "There's no real precedent for us to follow," he said. </seg>
<seg id="2375"> Washington's law, called I-502, takes effect on Dec. 6, which also leaves a year of limbo during which the state licensing system will not yet exist, but legalized possession will. </seg>
<seg id="2376"> And there are thorny mechanical questions that must be resolved during that time, like how to balance the state's mandate of "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with its prohibitions on cannabis businesses within 1,000 feet of a school, park, playground or child care center. </seg>
<seg id="2377"> "Nowhere will it be more difficult to site a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group. </seg>
<seg id="2378"> On Nov. 21, Chief Oates in Aurora sent his officers an e-mail announcing that the city attorney would no longer be prosecuting small marijuana violations for anyone 21 years or older, and that the police would stop charging people for those crimes "effective immediately." </seg>
<seg id="2379"> Chief Oates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical marijuana growers, and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and dealers. </seg>
<seg id="2380"> In northern Colorado's Weld County, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter view. </seg>
<seg id="2381"> After the vote, he said his office would continue pursuing marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2382"> Right now, 119 people face charges of possessing two ounces or less of marijuana, though many are facing other charges. </seg>
<seg id="2383"> "Our office has an obligation to prosecute offenses that were crimes at the time they occurred," Mr. Buck said in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2384"> The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative. </seg>
<seg id="2385"> The police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, are no longer citing adults for possession of small amounts. </seg>
<seg id="2386"> The county's district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supported that decision, but also decided not to dismiss all of the pending possession cases. </seg>
<seg id="2387"> "I do not think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said. </seg>
<seg id="2388"> Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the folds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple. </seg>
<seg id="2389"> And the contradictory reactions across the state lay bare a deep ambivalence among local officials about the state's big green experiment. </seg>
<seg id="2390"> "It's a cultural barrier" with district attorneys, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. </seg>
<seg id="2391"> "They spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still don't really accept that this is legal," he said. </seg>
<seg id="2392"> As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become national test cases for drug legalization. </seg>
<seg id="2393"> As advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of legalized sales, they are also anxiously awaiting direction from the federal government, which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes. </seg>
<seg id="2394"> Advocates for legalized marijuana are hoping the Justice Department yields. </seg>
<seg id="2395"> Despite some high-profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to operate in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states. </seg>
<seg id="2396"> While drug agents will probably not beat down doors to seize a small bag of the drug, they are likely to balk at allowing the state-regulated recreational marijuana shops allowed under the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration. </seg>
<seg id="2397"> Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act. </seg>
<seg id="2398"> Even before Election Day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana shops, even though it will be about a year before any can open. </seg>
<seg id="2399"> Last week, the western city of Montrose took up a six-month ban, and is likely to pass it next week. </seg>
<seg id="2400"> "We don't want to be put in a position where we license somebody and then have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a City Council member. </seg>
<seg id="2401"> Our community voted against this amendment. </seg>
<seg id="2402"> We're looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for. </seg>
<seg id="2403"> There's an awful lot of questions. </seg>
<seg id="2404"> Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford for being a Tory </seg>
<seg id="2405"> It is not just today's university students who are attacked for their views </seg>
<seg id="2406"> I can't remember a time when I didn't dream of winning a place at Oxford University. </seg>
<seg id="2407"> Both my father and my elder brother had been at what I imagined was the world's greatest seat of learning, a modern-day wine-blushed Greek symposium encouraging the dual pillars of civilisation, free thinking and tolerance. </seg>
<seg id="2408"> Yet, within two weeks of taking up my place at Worcester College in the late Eighties to read history, I'd packed my bags, precipitating the first scandal of my life. </seg>
<seg id="2409"> My father broke down and cried. </seg>
<seg id="2410"> Friends were baffled. </seg>
<seg id="2411"> The Evening Standard diary claimed I'd quit because I objected to fellow undergraduates having sex in the room next to mine. </seg>
<seg id="2412"> The writer A N Wilson announced waggishly that I'd departed because I was forced to drink out of chipped mugs. </seg>
<seg id="2413"> The truth was less droll. </seg>
<seg id="2414"> I ran away. </seg>
<seg id="2415"> Yes, ran, because I had been subject to systematic bullying and intimidation. </seg>
<seg id="2416"> Not on account of my rather outré name, or the fact that I came from a private school. </seg>
<seg id="2417"> I was persecuted for one reason only, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-profile adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative supporter. </seg>
<seg id="2418"> Why bring this up now, you might ask. </seg>
<seg id="2419"> Well, recent reports suggest that a new generation of Right-of-centre students are suffering a similar persecution. </seg>
<seg id="2420"> Such is the institutionalised and increasing hatred of Tory students at Oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same equal-rights protection as gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities. </seg>
<seg id="2421"> Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's junior common room (JCR) claim they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and made to feel unwelcome" because of their political views. </seg>
<seg id="2422"> They want to create a post on the college's equal opportunities committee to ensure that their opinions can be aired freely. </seg>
<seg id="2423"> Their situation wasn't helped by a recent BBC Two documentary, Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, about student politics, which portrayed Tories as oddballs and neo-Nazis. </seg>
<seg id="2424"> It featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), travelling in a Rolls-Royce, sporting a silver suit and silver-topped cane. </seg>
<seg id="2425"> At other universities, Conservative students say they are being treated as "scapegoats" for the introduction of higher tuition fees." </seg>
<seg id="2426"> Luke Black, 20, vice-president of Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing Left-wing bias at universities. </seg>
<seg id="2427"> People assume we are like the Bullingdon Club without meeting us." </seg>
<seg id="2428"> Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed the motion for greater protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cherill, 19, president elect of OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are Right of centre. </seg>
<seg id="2429"> "This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the welfare of members," she says. </seg>
<seg id="2430"> I was in a minority of one during my first few weeks at Oxford. </seg>
<seg id="2431"> I had gone up in September 1986, a cripplingly shy 18-year-old. </seg>
<seg id="2432"> Hatred of the Conservative Party was at its most febrile. </seg>
<seg id="2433"> The year before, the university had voted to refuse Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree, because of cuts in higher education funding. </seg>
<seg id="2434"> The atmosphere would have made a Stalinist shudder with apprehension. </seg>
<seg id="2435"> During the first few days of freshers" week, when new students socialise with each other and the dons, I had a taste of the wormwood that was to come. </seg>
<seg id="2436"> I was to find that the dons not only connived in the taunting of Tory undergraduates but took part with relish. </seg>
<seg id="2437"> The politics of the miners" strike, privatisation and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid South Africa were brought into the wood-panelled rooms of the tutorial. </seg>
<seg id="2438"> My first one involved translating 18th-century French texts into English, and I was unprepared for what followed. </seg>
<seg id="2439"> "Miss Wyatt," said the don, Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph." </seg>
<seg id="2440"> I stumbled over it. </seg>
<seg id="2441"> A small man with a face like cake batter, Pitt was big on bile. </seg>
<seg id="2442"> "Do Thatcherites refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he demanded. </seg>
<seg id="2443"> The other undergraduates giggled. </seg>
<seg id="2444"> Tears pricked the back of my eyes. </seg>
<seg id="2445"> "I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time - that is, if you're not too busy socialising," Pitt snarled. </seg>
<seg id="2446"> I walked back to my rooms a disconsolate figure. </seg>
<seg id="2447"> At dinner in college that evening I sat by myself; then I felt a light tap on my shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="2448"> It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA. </seg>
<seg id="2449"> "I know who you are," he said kindly. </seg>
<seg id="2450"> I'm afraid it's like that. </seg>
<seg id="2451"> Anyone suspected of being a Tory is picked on. </seg>
<seg id="2452"> It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you. </seg>
<seg id="2453"> Most Tory freshers pretend they're Labour. </seg>
<seg id="2454"> Later, at a local pub, I cravenly attempted to dissimulate. </seg>
<seg id="2455"> I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said. </seg>
<seg id="2456"> This ploy proved unsuccessful. </seg>
<seg id="2457"> A first year PPE student, who, ironically, had been to Eton, said: "You're the daughter of a fascist pig." </seg>
<seg id="2458"> You're contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="2459"> Other students took up the refrain. </seg>
<seg id="2460"> I was perverted, dirty. </seg>
<seg id="2461"> "How do Tories have sex?" one asked. </seg>
<seg id="2462"> They beat each other, don't they? </seg>
<seg id="2463"> I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the Sixties. </seg>
<seg id="2464"> Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford? </seg>
<seg id="2465"> Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark? </seg>
<seg id="2466"> Would I have to turn to Labour and suppress my natural inclinations? </seg>
<seg id="2467"> The three years before me stretched out as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation. </seg>
<seg id="2468"> The only openly Tory don was Norman Stone, Professor of Modern History, who was based at my college. </seg>
<seg id="2469"> He was hated for being not only a Conservative but a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her speech writers. </seg>
<seg id="2470"> He was hardly ever there. </seg>
<seg id="2471"> He loathed the place as provincial and petty, and for its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history. </seg>
<seg id="2472"> In 1997 he took up a professorship at the University of Bilkent, in Ankara, Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="2473"> "You won't be happy here," he told me. </seg>
<seg id="2474"> I began commuting from Oxford to my parents" house in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded metropolitan friends and family. </seg>
<seg id="2475"> I told my father I hated Oxford and why. </seg>
<seg id="2476"> He was incredulous. </seg>
<seg id="2477"> During his time there in the Forties, all political views had been accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2478"> "But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically. </seg>
<seg id="2479"> They wouldn't do that, not among my dreaming spires. </seg>
<seg id="2480"> Even my Communist friends always had impeccable manners. </seg>
<seg id="2481"> His rheumy eyes began to cloud. </seg>
<seg id="2482"> Give it a chance. </seg>
<seg id="2483"> I'm sure it's all just a tease. </seg>
<seg id="2484"> It would break my heart if you left. </seg>
<seg id="2485"> Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating. </seg>
<seg id="2486"> A male friend of mine, also a Tory supporter, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed. </seg>
<seg id="2487"> During a tutorial the following week, when another history don had suggested, in complete seriousness, that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="2488"> Inwardly blushing with shame, I admitted to being "brainwashed by my parents" and called them "old fools." </seg>
<seg id="2489"> The respite was short. </seg>
<seg id="2490"> It was my father who drove the nail into the coffin of my Oxford career. </seg>
<seg id="2491"> At the time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week. </seg>
<seg id="2492"> My door was locked. </seg>
<seg id="2493"> I cowered inside, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up. </seg>
<seg id="2494"> When they left, I packed a suitcase and caught the first train to London. </seg>
<seg id="2495"> I never went back. </seg>
<seg id="2496"> You may call me a snivelling wimp. </seg>
<seg id="2497"> But no 18-year-old should be subject to such intimidation and vitriol in an educational institution. </seg>
<seg id="2498"> Even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but, to this day, hides behind an ill-deserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought. </seg>
<seg id="2499"> "Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety" </seg>
<seg id="2500"> On the occasion of the "Valentino: Master of Couture," an exhibition that opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other of the Italian designer's famous clients. </seg>
<seg id="2501"> Somerset House, former home of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Valentino Garavani exhibition. </seg>
<seg id="2502"> During the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Couture," the designer acknowledged a retrospective apotheosis that brings together over 130 couture gowns created by his fashion house over the past 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2503"> "I love this palace" he says, in his unmistakable Italian accent. </seg>
<seg id="2504"> This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "signore" Garavani, although it could not have been written without his distinguished clients. </seg>
<seg id="2505"> Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of the nobility. </seg>
<seg id="2506"> In the first room of the exhibition, open until March 3, there are a number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece to Margaret of England. </seg>
<seg id="2507"> Valentino exhibits these personal memories as if they were trophies of his social ascent from humble couturier in Voghera, northern Italy, to idol of the international jet-set. </seg>
<seg id="2508"> There is nothing wrong with loving royalty. </seg>
<seg id="2509"> "At least they don't drop cigarette ends on your magnificent carpet, like some beautiful pop music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza. </seg>
<seg id="2510"> In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends. </seg>
<seg id="2511"> Valentino is a spectacular host whose entertains with generosity and elegance. </seg>
<seg id="2512"> "We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad" says "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife, a close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos. </seg>
<seg id="2513"> Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety. </seg>
<seg id="2514"> And yet, he is a star. </seg>
<seg id="2515"> Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino. </seg>
<seg id="2516"> The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also recalls the couturier's charisma. </seg>
<seg id="2517"> Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went for dinner at his flat. </seg>
<seg id="2518"> There were twenty of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr. </seg>
<seg id="2519"> You could see and feel his "spirit" in every detail of the flat and its decor, the food and the music. </seg>
<seg id="2520"> "All the guests were made to feel important and loved" recalls the top model, who started working with him during Haute Couture Week Paris, in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2521"> "His designs are works of art and so never go out of fashion" she concludes. </seg>
<seg id="2522"> Nobility parade </seg>
<seg id="2523"> Garavani's life is not a story of obsession, but of well reciprocated love. </seg>
<seg id="2524"> He loves well-educated people who come from good backgrounds, and they love him. </seg>
<seg id="2525"> One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous, sixty-foot long catwalk which offers a role reversal: visitors take the place of the models and have to parade down the catwalk while looking at a dream "audience" wearing Valentino masterpieces, for example, the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte" and the wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba. </seg>
<seg id="2526"> In this crowd of mannequins, names stand out such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sofia of Habsburg. </seg>
<seg id="2527"> Naty Abascal and the designer, in 2006 </seg>
<seg id="2528"> Many of these clients say your first Valentino is like your first love, "impossible to forget." </seg>
<seg id="2529"> I remember it perfectly. </seg>
<seg id="2530"> It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a "gilet" waistcoat and jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection. </seg>
<seg id="2531"> "It was a gift he gave me" says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses. </seg>
<seg id="2532"> "I prefer him to other designers because of his femininity, his great love of women, and because he enhances our beauty" added the former Duchess of Feria. </seg>
<seg id="2533"> I love the colours he uses, they really stand out and "lend themselves" to your face. </seg>
<seg id="2534"> Their proportions are perfect. </seg>
<seg id="2535"> The princess and fashion advisor Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg also remembers the first time she wore a Valentino. </seg>
<seg id="2536"> As a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of reaching the age when I'd have the chance to wear one of his evening gowns... </seg>
<seg id="2537"> My time finally came in the late '90s. </seg>
<seg id="2538"> I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party in the castle belonging to my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne. </seg>
<seg id="2539"> It was a red dress, with a frilly skirt, draped "corsage" and a strapless neckline. </seg>
<seg id="2540"> "It was a dream come true" says Princess D'Arenberg, the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2541"> "Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless" says this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires. </seg>
<seg id="2542"> Princess D'Arenberg looks after her couturier gowns with "the utmost care ... because a dress not just a dress, it's also the many memories that go with it." </seg>
<seg id="2543"> The "king" of fashion </seg>
<seg id="2544"> The "grand finale" of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995. </seg>
<seg id="2545"> It took four months' work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstresses) to create the pearl-encrusted, ivory-coloured silk gown with twelve different types of lace and a train four and a half metres long. </seg>
<seg id="2546"> According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the leading authority of the specialist press, that dress represents a high fashion milestone of the late 20th century, "the return of high society clients." </seg>
<seg id="2547"> Dazzled for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now its finest exponent. </seg>
<seg id="2548"> Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest-ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and awarded the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as many honours as any of his clients' husbands. </seg>
<seg id="2549"> "I've always been struck by his refined and calm manner, and his neat and perfect appearance" acknowledges D'Arenberg. </seg>
<seg id="2550"> The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum. </seg>
<seg id="2551"> He was on the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine. </seg>
<seg id="2552"> "He was immaculate, time stands still for him." </seg>
<seg id="2553"> If a princess says that... </seg>
<seg id="2554"> The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen </seg>
<seg id="2555"> For four euros, the Indonesian volcano porters risk life and limb carrying 70 kilos of sulphur along steep stone paths. </seg>
<seg id="2556"> There are people for whom work is hell, and others who - literally - work in hell. </seg>
<seg id="2557"> This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make their living taking sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java. </seg>
<seg id="2558"> To do so, he has to descend every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphurous gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with air. </seg>
<seg id="2559"> After breaking off large sulphur rocks, which in total can weigh up to 70 kilos, he carries them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders along the steep stone paths. </seg>
<seg id="2560"> It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres above sea level, but the exhausted porters take over 40 minutes to get there, at snail's pace, keeping their balance and measuring their steps carefully to avoid slipping and falling over the precipice. </seg>
<seg id="2561"> They know that one slip could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who plunged to her death a few years ago on the hazardous Kawah Ijen cliffs. </seg>
<seg id="2562"> The Kawah Ijen miners are paid 5 euro cents for each kilo of sulphur removed. </seg>
<seg id="2563"> Once at the top, they make their way past the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and then, lugging their heavy baskets, they walk three kilometres to the scales installed by a mining company a little further down, 1,850 metres above sea level. </seg>
<seg id="2564"> This is PT Ngrimbi Candi, a company which, since 1960, has been exploiting the volcano, and quite literally its workers, whom it pays 662 rupees (5 euro cents) per kilo of sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2565"> It then sells the sulphur for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as the mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used in the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening sugar. </seg>
<seg id="2566"> "We generally carry 70 kilos, so we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) a trip" explains Anto, who usually make three trips a day. </seg>
<seg id="2567"> Each one takes three hours and you end up exhausted, but it means he gets 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day. </seg>
<seg id="2568"> Although it seems a pittance for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn in the field. </seg>
<seg id="2569"> "Miners' wages are very high here, whereas coffee harvesting is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros) " explains the porter, who previously worked as a mason in the island resort of Bali. </seg>
<seg id="2570"> There, his wage was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the work was not as hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a compelling reason which, in Indonesia, is as overriding as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindu, and I've brought her to Java to convert to Islam." </seg>
<seg id="2571"> Anto has asthma, he has difficulty breathing, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases. </seg>
<seg id="2572"> At 27 years old, Anto has been risking his life for three years in the Kawah Ijen volcano, and the sulphur has already begun to take its toll on him, even though he covers his face with special mask and goggles. </seg>
<seg id="2573"> He has asthma, he has difficulty breathing, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2574"> This is the price you have to pay to realise your dreams. </seg>
<seg id="2575"> "I'll go on working two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French" he vows in more than acceptable English. </seg>
<seg id="2576"> Punished for life, this pleasant, intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule. </seg>
<seg id="2577"> Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulphur doesn't stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and it glows in the dark. </seg>
<seg id="2578"> Defying the shadows, Anto descends the crater and lights the path with a small torch attached to the helmet he bought with his money. </seg>
<seg id="2579"> Some 400 porters carry sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the crater. </seg>
<seg id="2580"> Despite their huge profits, the mining company has not mechanised the sulphur extraction process to save costs, nor has it provided any equipment for the porters, who work for themselves and by the kilo. </seg>
<seg id="2581"> In fact, they do not even see any of the 30,000 rupee (2.5 euro) per camera surcharge that, on top of the 15,000 rupee (1.2 euro) entrance fee, the guards of this natural reserve charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and their human mules. </seg>
<seg id="2582"> "This work is for animals, not people" protests Madrusin, a burly 42-year porter who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving school. </seg>
<seg id="2583"> He can lift up to 110 kilos, ensuring that he will go on working "all he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged between 18 [months?] and 10 years old. </seg>
<seg id="2584"> I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life. </seg>
<seg id="2585"> Although the sulphur burns your throat and stings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that no-one complains of serious illnesses... apart, of course, from their common respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, knee pain and sores on the shoulders, which have been misshapen by the weight of the baskets. </seg>
<seg id="2586"> Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos now he is 53 years old. </seg>
<seg id="2587"> Every day, he and his fellow workers break off 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, which three lorries move to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometres away along a goat path that passes through scrubland. </seg>
<seg id="2588"> "I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life" says Unainik, opening a mouth full of gaps where teeth use to be. </seg>
<seg id="2589"> The oldest of his five children, 30 years old, also works carrying sulphur. </seg>
<seg id="2590"> Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation in one of the hardest jobs in the world: the one done by human mules in the Kawah Ijen volcano. </seg>
<seg id="2591"> Singapore seeks babies to save its economy </seg>
<seg id="2592"> Singaporeans blame their careers, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children. </seg>
<seg id="2593"> "Singapore's population needs to grow." </seg>
<seg id="2594"> I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, let's do our civic duty and create life! </seg>
<seg id="2595"> It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an advert for mint sweets, but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year. </seg>
<seg id="2596"> The phrases are part of a rap and make use of local references such as "Let's put a bao (bun) in the oven" to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2597"> The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hopeful that the advertisement will manage to focus attention to the problem in a fun way. </seg>
<seg id="2598"> Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their "national duty." </seg>
<seg id="2599"> It's purely an Internet thing, so we had to make it fun and amusing. </seg>
<seg id="2600"> It's the biggest problem facing this country. </seg>
<seg id="2601"> We are the world's worst at reproducing our own progeny, so we felt it was an issue we had to address. </seg>
<seg id="2602"> We knew the Government had tried many things, like launching perfumes with pheromones or organising speed dating evenings. </seg>
<seg id="2603"> Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work. </seg>
<seg id="2604"> So we thought: why not be as creative as possible to solve the problem, by composing a rap? </seg>
<seg id="2605"> 1.2 children </seg>
<seg id="2606"> But the Singapore Government is not taking it so lightly. </seg>
<seg id="2607"> It spends USD 1,300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="2608"> A government package for marriages and parents grants up to USD 15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits. </seg>
<seg id="2609"> But this has all had little effect. </seg>
<seg id="2610"> Singapore is a rich, high technology city State in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls. </seg>
<seg id="2611"> The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. </seg>
<seg id="2612"> The last time it was over 2, known as the replacement rate, was in 1976. </seg>
<seg id="2613"> So why are Singaporeans not having children? </seg>
<seg id="2614"> Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, said that it is a result of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities." </seg>
<seg id="2615"> "This has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family" he explains. </seg>
<seg id="2616"> These changes in social norms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single, and delaying marriage and births, which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore. </seg>
<seg id="2617"> Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline has created resentment among the local population. </seg>
<seg id="2618"> In Singapore, there are websites where xenophobia against many new immigrants is widespread and thinly disguised, especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating. </seg>
<seg id="2619"> Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why, last year, the Singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence. </seg>
<seg id="2620"> Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest taxes and levies for foreign workers. </seg>
<seg id="2621"> Unexpected consequences </seg>
<seg id="2622"> While a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, in Singapore's case there are also some unexpected consequences. </seg>
<seg id="2623"> The Government is trying not to build so many small houses. </seg>
<seg id="2624"> For example, it has started to influence the real estate sector. </seg>
<seg id="2625"> Its urban development authority has started to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes," which can be built in certain areas of the city. </seg>
<seg id="2626"> These apartments have a surface of 46 square metres and have been very successful in terms of sales. </seg>
<seg id="2627"> However, there is concern that they may promote a single-living lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family houses. </seg>
<seg id="2628"> But, Lim Yew Soon, managing director of the real estate company EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2629"> They are more popular, in the sense that the units sell days, even weeks, faster than larger units. </seg>
<seg id="2630"> This means they are much better for our cash flow. </seg>
<seg id="2631"> However, he admits that the new regulations give clearer guidance to developers, who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project. </seg>
<seg id="2632"> Too stressed </seg>
<seg id="2633"> Singapore is a city State. </seg>
<seg id="2634"> Although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, when talking to Singaporeans working in the central financial district, it seems they will not have much impact. </seg>
<seg id="2635"> "People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so a lot of people are putting off having a family" says a young executive. </seg>
<seg id="2636"> Other people can have children. </seg>
<seg id="2637"> "But, for me, it is important to have my own money and time" says another young man of around 20 years old. </seg>
<seg id="2638"> Men and women alike mention their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children. </seg>
<seg id="2639"> So, much as the Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, the Singaporeans have the last word. </seg>
<seg id="2640"> What is private offline is private online </seg>
<seg id="2641"> Privacy. </seg>
<seg id="2642"> According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, it means the quality of private life or "the level of privacy which a person is entitled to protect from any interference." </seg>
<seg id="2643"> What is privacy for an under 16? </seg>
<seg id="2644"> How do you apply this definition to their daily life and social networks? </seg>
<seg id="2645"> Do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by airing information over the Internet which they probably would not share offline? </seg>
<seg id="2646"> ElPeriódico interviewed five children aged between ten and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users. </seg>
<seg id="2647"> In four cases, they associated the term with "something very much mine" on a personal level, and "in the user name and password" when applied to social networks. </seg>
<seg id="2648"> "I wouldn't upload my deepest secrets in a post" says Jorge, aged ten, when trying to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, with which he has had accounts for two years. </seg>
<seg id="2649"> "They are very secret secrets, I'll tell my mother, but not everybody" he says. </seg>
<seg id="2650"> On FB I upload nice pictures or games. </seg>
<seg id="2651"> And I have fun with people I know. </seg>
<seg id="2652"> "I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine, or that belongs to somebody who's doing something stupid" he says. </seg>
<seg id="2653"> The child recognises that it is bad to post obscene pictures of naked people, crimes, or write humiliating or aggressive comments. </seg>
<seg id="2654"> Jorge says he knows the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2655"> Most are relatives. </seg>
<seg id="2656"> His mother is included, and she has the password to one of the accounts. </seg>
<seg id="2657"> I opened Twitter to express myself and post interesting tweets. </seg>
<seg id="2658"> "I don't know if they answer me, I only upload them" he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2659"> "Social networking is fun, I can talk quickly to relatives far away or my friends" he says. </seg>
<seg id="2660"> He does not hesitate to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person. </seg>
<seg id="2661"> Nor would he take any notice of someone who recommends a stranger to him. </seg>
<seg id="2662"> The case of Joseph, aged 14, is different. </seg>
<seg id="2663"> This teenager has accounts with Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the last case he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list. </seg>
<seg id="2664"> "It doesn't bother me, because we have something in common, like music" he says. </seg>
<seg id="2665"> The boy says that no-one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number. </seg>
<seg id="2666"> "If they pressured me or asked me for it, I'd just delete them from my account" he states. </seg>
<seg id="2667"> Joseph became a follower on Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="2668"> This teenager is not alien to experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying. </seg>
<seg id="2669"> An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being pestered on a social network. </seg>
<seg id="2670"> They were threatening him and demanding money from him. </seg>
<seg id="2671"> "I never found out who it was" he says. </seg>
<seg id="2672"> The victim, according to José, did not close his account. </seg>
<seg id="2673"> "He just made it private." </seg>
<seg id="2674"> He then explains a series of steps to configure the account safely. </seg>
<seg id="2675"> Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations. </seg>
<seg id="2676"> I would do it if I didn't like somebody, or they made me want to do it. </seg>
<seg id="2677"> "However, I know that's cyberbullying" he admits. </seg>
<seg id="2678"> Key questions </seg>
<seg id="2679"> Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and teenagers, they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform. </seg>
<seg id="2680"> "The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these websites, the rules of the game changed" he says. </seg>
<seg id="2681"> Porras says the scholar Marc Prensky, with a Master's degree in Education from Yale University and author of the work Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon. </seg>
<seg id="2682"> Digital natives are those children and young people born with technology. </seg>
<seg id="2683"> "We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, when we are still in fact learning" he says. </seg>
<seg id="2684"> He says that the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or divulge, at an age at which maturity is not conducive to this." </seg>
<seg id="2685"> "They also have to be selective when what matters most is to be popular and have thousands of friends, without thinking of the consequences" he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2686"> According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and teenagers what privacy is, is through questions that make them think. </seg>
<seg id="2687"> "Telling them not to do it is no good" he adds. </seg>
<seg id="2688"> Porras then lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do it online? </seg>
<seg id="2689"> Or, would you like a friend to publish a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend? </seg>
<seg id="2690"> Do you know what others publish about you? </seg>
<seg id="2691"> When tagging party photos, did you ask the other people's permission to tag them? </seg>
<seg id="2692"> And one more question: does everyone need to know what you're doing all the time? </seg>
<seg id="2693"> Another point is to make them see that they must behave online as they do offline. </seg>
<seg id="2694"> The rules are the same. </seg>
<seg id="2695"> "Outside the Internet, people act with respect, morality and other principles, so they should act the same way on social networks" he says. </seg>
<seg id="2696"> Monitoring </seg>
<seg id="2697"> Stuart Guard, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says it is essential for parents to read social networks' policies thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="2698"> By understanding all the clauses, they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an online account. </seg>
<seg id="2699"> "For example, the age at which you are allowed to share or publish" he says. </seg>
<seg id="2700"> According to Guardia, it is important to remind children the "don't talk to strangers" lesson. </seg>
<seg id="2701"> Unasur Summit closes without making public the Lima Declaration </seg>
<seg id="2702"> The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attendee leaders. </seg>
<seg id="2703"> Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Sixth UNASUR Meeting of Heads of State and Government, but Presidential and Chancellery sources initially said they would deliver it after the summit closed, but later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the Peruvian Government website. </seg>
<seg id="2704"> When asked about the text, they pointed out that the content had been disclosed by Peruvian President, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press. </seg>
<seg id="2705"> Journalists' access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times. </seg>
<seg id="2706"> During the summit, in the press room, only video was aired, with no sound, showing the presidential meeting with the message "closed session, audio restricted." </seg>
<seg id="2707"> The little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press spokesmen of some of the UNASUR governments attending the meeting, but not the Peruvian Government. </seg>
<seg id="2708"> The only document released during the summit was the list of attending presidents, which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who asked for more details. </seg>
<seg id="2709"> The Peruvian President then sent an email to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but this was Humala's statement, and not the official document that closed the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2710"> Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American-Arab Countries (ASPA), and this time, despite repeated requests from the press, the previously announced Lima Declaration was again not made public. </seg>
<seg id="2711"> The ASPA official website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="2712"> At both international events, the Peruvian authorities were at pains to ensure that there were broadcasting systems assured for all the journalists, but limited the obtaining of information to a maximum. </seg>
<seg id="2713"> The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court to adjudicate a border dispute between the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2714"> The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional event and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which on Monday, at The Hague, will start to hear the arguments of both parties, in the lawsuit Lima has filed against Santiago. </seg>
<seg id="2715"> "We will obey and execute the order that currently defines the differences we are bringing before this international court" said Humala, together with his Chilean counterpart. </seg>
<seg id="2716"> "Chile has been, is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts" added Piñera, greeting Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of the two countries. </seg>
<seg id="2717"> Confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogotá Pact, whereby it accepted to submit to the judgement of this international court, following a decision on its maritime boundary with Nicaragua which it regarded as seriously flawed. </seg>
<seg id="2718"> The summit was held with the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="2719"> Paraguay, which was suspended by UNASUR in 2011 after the dismissal of former President Fernando Lugo, was not involved in the meeting. </seg>
<seg id="2720"> Host President Ollanta Humala was responsible for opening the session in the morning and closing the summit, just after noon in Lima. </seg>
<seg id="2721"> The President read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans laid down for 31 projects between the South American countries, for a total of 17 billion dollars of investments. </seg>
<seg id="2722"> Among the resolutions adopted, it was mentioned that UNASUR countries will take "important steps toward the goal of a South American citizenship, for which residence agreements are being extended." </seg>
<seg id="2723"> He reported that actions are being implemented to improve "cooperation in the fight against insecurity and transnational organised crime, actions to make medication more accessible, low-cost Internet access in all areas of South America, and to deal jointly and efficiently with risks of natural disasters." </seg>
<seg id="2724"> With Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not have a triumphalist attitude but should serve to expand its productive matrix and glimpse a better future for its people" Humala added. </seg>
<seg id="2725"> "We decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve connection among areas of South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and creating new economic networks" said the Peruvian President in a message read out. </seg>
<seg id="2726"> Among these projects, he mentioned that five are in Peru and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, between the coast and Brazil, and two focus on increased connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details. </seg>
<seg id="2727"> Also, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay. </seg>
<seg id="2728"> "We hope the electoral process in that country serves to reincorporate it in the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded. </seg>
<seg id="2729"> The need for Latin America to remain a prosperous, peaceful and integrated nation, with good neighbourly relations, was another issue highlighted by the summit. </seg>
<seg id="2730"> In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before attending the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico, to respectfully discuss the maritime dispute after the failure of the ICJ, questioned by Bogota. </seg>
<seg id="2731"> "The day after tomorrow (Saturday) I might have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega" Santos said. </seg>
<seg id="2732"> "We will review all these paths, [which] are not exclusive, and the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua" he emphasised. </seg>
<seg id="2733"> "With President Ortega, I hope I can say that we handle this in the most civilised and respectful manner possible" said Santos. </seg>
<seg id="2734"> Santos and Ortega are due to meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they expect to attend the inauguration of the country's new President, Enrique Peña Nieto. </seg>
<seg id="2735"> Also, as part of the summit, the bloc's foreign defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region. </seg>
<seg id="2736"> Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay make up UNASUR, although the latter is currently suspended. </seg>
<seg id="2737"> Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc. </seg>
<seg id="2738"> "South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizenship" says Rafael Correa </seg>
<seg id="2739"> The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that "South America, in this case, must learn from Europe." </seg>
<seg id="2740"> Correa, who took part in the Eleventh Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peru's state television that Europeans "killed one another in the Second World War" and other conflicts, "but are now practically one country." </seg>
<seg id="2741"> To this end, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by member countries of UNASUR. </seg>
<seg id="2742"> "We have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is already the situation with members of the Andean Community. However, there are still reactionary sectors that want us to return to the past" he said. </seg>
<seg id="2743"> The Ecuadorian President was also in favour of the restructuring of the Organisation of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the Pact of San José on human rights. </seg>
<seg id="2744"> Those who speak with authority never commit to anything, whereas we South Americans sign everything. </seg>
<seg id="2745"> "It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding" he said referring to Ecuador giving political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. </seg>
<seg id="2746"> Correa said he does not regret that decision because with it he has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his "deep democratic and human rights values." </seg>
<seg id="2747"> He added that, at the time, "he had reasonable suspicion that Assange would be extradited to another country and that his case would not be respected." </seg>
<seg id="2748"> Additionally, he criticised the Swedish courts for demanding that he be subject to questioning for an alleged sexual offence in his country, when "Swedish legislation itself dictates that he can be questioned via videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London." </seg>
<seg id="2749"> Correa said that there is a risk of deterioration of Assange's physical and mental health. </seg>
<seg id="2750"> "I have not spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem, nothing serious" said the Ecuadorian President. </seg>
<seg id="2751"> What there is, is the danger that his physical and mental health may deteriorate due to being locked in a small space without any outdoor exercise. </seg>
<seg id="2752"> "That would complicate the health of any person" he added. </seg>
<seg id="2753"> Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange in June by the Ecuadorian Embassy, in London, through the issue of a safe-conduct pass that permits travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, and stressed that there have been talks with London to seek a solution to the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder. </seg>
<seg id="2754"> We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions. </seg>
<seg id="2755"> "The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzon, is handling a series of cases in different European courts" he said. </seg>
<seg id="2756"> And he felt that "if Britain says no to the safe-conduct pass, it's over." </seg>
<seg id="2757"> And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly well allows it to do, and as it has done in other cases, questions Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem is over. </seg>
<seg id="2758"> Correa took the opportunity to reassert himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, dishonesty and lies that undermine the freedom of expression." </seg>
<seg id="2759"> "The greatest enemies of the press freedom are not evil and wicked politicians, but bad journalists depending on profit, blackmail and extortion" he said. </seg>
<seg id="2760"> In that regard, he welcomed the fact that it was no longer these journalists, "or the bankers or bourgeois and hegemonic countries that dominate Ecuador" and said that, if re-elected, he will "step up the revolution to continue on the same path and in the right direction." </seg>
<seg id="2761"> Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in UNASUR, at least until their next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and a coup masked with legality" because this will in fact "destroy the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy." </seg>
<seg id="2762"> The Ecuadorian President also considered the "perfectly pertinent" desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundary between the two countries, after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, in favour Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty. </seg>
<seg id="2763"> For now that ruling is not being followed. </seg>
<seg id="2764"> It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one. </seg>
<seg id="2765"> Conflict is inevitable, but must be overcome by the desire to walk together. </seg>
<seg id="2766"> They need to be processed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move forward. </seg>
<seg id="2767"> Additionally, he trusted in a sound conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute opposing Peru and Chile in the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing, however hard it may be." </seg>
<seg id="2768"> With reference to the possibility of his standing as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador seeking a third consecutive term, he said he sees that possibility "with much optimism and joy, although at times it is pretty hard." </seg>
<seg id="2769"> Correa said that if he loses the elections in February 2013, he will retire from public life. </seg>
<seg id="2770"> Personally, I've never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power. </seg>
<seg id="2771"> "My political movement believed that it was me who ensured that probable victory, so we have to accept that responsibility" he said. </seg>
<seg id="2772"> If I won, it would be my last period in office and then I would leave public life. </seg>
<seg id="2773"> If I lose, likewise. </seg>
<seg id="2774"> "It's a decision" he confirmed. </seg>
<seg id="2775"> Correa also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's new health treatment in Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2776"> I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that Chavez went for treatment that was already planned, routine treatment, and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to Cuba. </seg>
<seg id="2777"> "This does not mean a health relapse for President Chavez" he said. </seg>
<seg id="2778"> In Lima today, the Ecuadorian Head of State attended the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security. </seg>
<seg id="2779"> Deaths caused by AIDS are nowadays due to late detection </seg>
<seg id="2780"> Fabrizio was 21 years old when they confirmed his test result: HIV positive. </seg>
<seg id="2781"> "It was like a bomb dropped on me" he says, recalling the time of the announcement, which the doctor was trying to make "softer," apparently unsuccessfully. </seg>
<seg id="2782"> The boy hid it from his family. </seg>
<seg id="2783"> He decided to care for his illness alone and began to learn about it; thanks to his efforts he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday. </seg>
<seg id="2784"> He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (CHG), where he arrived in 1994 after several battles with his health. </seg>
<seg id="2785"> Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, hard to imagine in the early '90s, when there were many questions, few treatment options and a great deal of stigma. </seg>
<seg id="2786"> Then, even the director of an IMSS [Mexican Social Security Institute] clinic refused to discharge him "because he had a cut." </seg>
<seg id="2787"> At that time, having Aids was synonymous with death. </seg>
<seg id="2788"> Now it is possible to survive the syndrome and do so with quality of life. </seg>
<seg id="2789"> However, many people are still unaware of their illness, and only seek help when the virus has already caused havoc, "exhausted" their immune systems and they are suffering from opportunistic infections. </seg>
<seg id="2790"> 31 years after of the onset of AIDS around the world, at least since the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time is that the life expectancy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expectancy of the general population is exactly equal" stated the head of the CHG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal. </seg>
<seg id="2791"> Infectious disease specialist and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008 scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence, but that life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients present when they are diagnosed, with a higher life expectancy for non-drug users: up to 30 years for patients with a 200 CD4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 CD4 count. </seg>
<seg id="2792"> In simple terms, this means that anyone diagnosed HIV positive at 25 years old, under these terms and "as long as they keep it under control, can live with no problems to 75" said the interviewee. </seg>
<seg id="2793"> To gauge this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years. </seg>
<seg id="2794"> Although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years and, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died. </seg>
<seg id="2795"> In Jalisco alone, only 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 deaths up to May of this year; however, we are assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005. </seg>
<seg id="2796"> - Why are do still deaths occur? </seg>
<seg id="2797"> - I think the problem is not to do with access to treatment. </seg>
<seg id="2798"> That's how I view it, and that's how it's been at our hospital. </seg>
<seg id="2799"> For at least the last 12 years we've had no shortage of medicine, the problem is that patients arrive in an advanced state of illness because they are unaware of their HIV status, that is to say, the later stages of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="2800"> He gave a compelling statistic: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, so what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, offer mass detection tests for everyone who needs them. " </seg>
<seg id="2801"> Specialists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA) agree on this proposal, as do the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who came to be tested at a private laboratory, motivated only because a friend had done so and, despite his young age, he was around in the AIDS era and had even suffered Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that is one of the common complications. </seg>
<seg id="2802"> Everything changes when you know you have AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="2803"> Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything. </seg>
<seg id="2804"> "If I'm going to die, I'd rather have a blow-out three times a week" they say, but not in my case. </seg>
<seg id="2805"> The change was for the better; I eat well, I exercise, I take my drugs. </seg>
<seg id="2806"> To date, his parents are only aware he had cancer. </seg>
<seg id="2807"> I live as normal a life as anyone else. </seg>
<seg id="2808"> "I work, I take part in a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of myself and the other person" said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate secrets with MILENIO JALISCO, to motivate those people with his story who today, in the context of World AIDS Day, are afraid. </seg>
<seg id="2809"> They should get tested if they are at risk. because the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they have already been diagnosed, they must learn to live like any other person, while being responsible. </seg>
<seg id="2810"> This is his message, which summarises the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012. </seg>
<seg id="2811"> Condoms behind the counter. </seg>
<seg id="2812"> The gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens are huge, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the HIV cause. </seg>
<seg id="2813"> And the greatest cure is prevention. </seg>
<seg id="2814"> In places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased; previously, they used to give us one or two, now they give us packets of a hundred, and that's fine, but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access condoms" he said. </seg>
<seg id="2815"> Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers. </seg>
<seg id="2816"> "Why do you want them?" is a common question, asked with sarcasm and judged according to the values of social workers, counsellors, pharmacy workers and healthcare staff who do not want to expose teenagers to sex, said the speaker. </seg>
<seg id="2817"> It was decided to change such inefficient allocation, and that condoms should not only be placed behind counters, but that packets of one hundred should be found in public toilet dispensers in places frequented by young people. </seg>
<seg id="2818"> This is not promoting promiscuity. </seg>
<seg id="2819"> It is not about paying for their beers or motel fees, as Governor Emilio Gonzalez said, when asked if there would be distribution of condoms during his administration. </seg>
<seg id="2820"> "And it's not about sexuality, but it is best to provide condoms to those already practising sexual activity" he said. </seg>
<seg id="2821"> Jalisco key points </seg>
<seg id="2822"> There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV). </seg>
<seg id="2823"> The state is 4th in the nation in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV. </seg>
<seg id="2824"> 92% of new infections are through sex, 6% via the bloodstream and 2% perinatal. </seg>
<seg id="2825"> An estimated 50,000 people may be living with HIV, as for each registered case there are around 4-5 people who do not know they are positive. </seg>
<seg id="2826"> Ratified by a United States court of appeal, a judgement which ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved via a bankruptcy in Mexico, the scenario is an ominous precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems. </seg>
<seg id="2827"> It seems, then, that the proceedings in support of survival of firms permit Mexican law are not valid in the land of stars and stripes, contrary to international conventions. </seg>
<seg id="2828"> In practical terms, the endorsement of the judgement delivered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court of the Northern District of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenceless against possible seizure of their property outside of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2829"> However, the decision opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies. </seg>
<seg id="2830"> From the start, while the trial judge notes that creditors should be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code, the Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, states that the main action is the insolvency action handled in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2831"> The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with transnational profiles. </seg>
<seg id="2832"> Indeed, the UN Model Law for International Trade Law Uniformity was created for this purpose, with the American Law Institute positioned as arbitrator. </seg>
<seg id="2833"> Secondly, the judgement establishes that without the intercompany vote, with the debts the Vitro subsidiaries had with their parent company recognised in the critical mass of the insolvency, the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved. </seg>
<seg id="2834"> However, Mexican law recognises the possibility. </seg>
<seg id="2835"> In fact, the Vitro case was not the first one in which the scheme was accepted. </seg>
<seg id="2836"> There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute. </seg>
<seg id="2837"> What is also certain is that, not including the votes of subsidiaries, the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the US courts, namely "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, did not achieve a majority. </seg>
<seg id="2838"> The vote was apparently 45 percent versus 37. </seg>
<seg id="2839"> This data is omitted by the Court of Appeal. </seg>
<seg id="2840"> From another perspective, the latter blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, while trying to avoid the severe economic crisis faced by the United States, turning its back on the country. </seg>
<seg id="2841"> For now, the Gonzalez Sada family firm has lodged a motion for reconsideration before the Court of Appeal for the vote to reach the plenary of the court, that is, the five judges, given that only three voted previously. </seg>
<seg id="2842"> Should this fail, an appeal for review by a higher court, in this case the US Supreme Court, will be filed. </seg>
<seg id="2843"> The real problem is that the court bypassed a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the capacity of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Commercial Insolvency Law, noting that the latter discharged itself with adherence to the agreements signed by the two countries to link it with Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States. </seg>
<seg id="2844"> Moreover, it should be noted that the country yielded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, ensuring fairness for debtors and creditors. </seg>
<seg id="2845"> Double whammy: Vitro hit and country hit. </seg>
<seg id="2846"> Balance Sheet </seg>
<seg id="2847"> With the complaints put on the table by the unions of Mexicana Airlines against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of mismanagement, dormant for several months, the Airline Pilots Union Association already found the bottleneck. </seg>
<seg id="2848"> The proceedings headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice. </seg>
<seg id="2849"> The claim is that the supervisory authority has consistently refused to provide reports to the Attorney General's Office on a transaction carried out by the employer to remove 198 million pesos from trust F/589 of Banco IXE, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación. </seg>
<seg id="2850"> The resources were apparently channelled towards the purchase of shares in the company Administradora Profesional de Hoteles. </seg>
<seg id="2851"> As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain. </seg>
<seg id="2852"> Opposing Dragon Mart </seg>
<seg id="2853"> A group of local and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of the public gathered at the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean to approve the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun. </seg>
<seg id="2854"> As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, selling Chinese products, with a residential area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies. </seg>

<seg id="2865"> Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life" </seg>
<seg id="2866"> Basketball globetrotter Hector "Hetin" Reyes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and, thanks to it, travelled the world. </seg>
<seg id="2867"> Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental recollection of local basketball history as broad as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2868"> Reyes was immersed in the sport for over 60 years before being confined to a wheelchair in 2008 following a stroke; he was a minor league player, National Superior Basketball player, BSN representative and manager with the Bayamón Vaqueros or President of the Basketball Federation. </seg>
<seg id="2869"> "I wore lots of hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager and federative president of the National Team during the '90s," recalled Reyes during Primera Hora's visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his loyal wife for over 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="2870"> "Basketball has been my life." </seg>
<seg id="2871"> Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes that statement. </seg>
<seg id="2872"> The walls of his house are almost totally decorated with pictures and memorabilia denoting his long career, which goes to prove it. </seg>
<seg id="2873"> Bayamón at heart </seg>
<seg id="2874"> Of them all, the ones he treasures with the most emotion are the ones that remind him of his time spent with the Vaqueros, from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he completed 15 years serving as co-agent or agent of the franchise. </seg>
<seg id="2875"> "Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the Vaqueros' eight championships, since 1967, either as agent, co-agent or manager. </seg>
<seg id="2876"> There were many good years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975. </seg>
<seg id="2877"> And then I said goodbye with one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year in the BSN. </seg>
<seg id="2878"> Then "Cuco" Ortiz took over - he was a great manager" said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2879"> I remember that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me 'I've got a very strong player for you, 6'7" tall. </seg>
<seg id="2880"> Do you want him?' </seg>
<seg id="2881"> And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had. </seg>
<seg id="2882"> Bartow then recommended the sharpshooter Gausse Raymond, who established residency here and was one of our best shooters. </seg>
<seg id="2883"> I remember him saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon one championship, Gausse would help get another. </seg>
<seg id="2884"> The Vaqueros' championship with Gausse was enjoyed, but from a distance, because in 1988 he was already becoming a federative bigshot. </seg>
<seg id="2885"> For that time, he preferred to enjoy his own and Mincy's accomplishments in the national team. </seg>
<seg id="2886"> I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the 1989 Pre-Olympics in Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="2887"> Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and it should have been bronze, but for the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, said Reyes. </seg>
<seg id="2888"> Is the 1990 World National Team the best you've ever seen? </seg>
<seg id="2889"> It's one of the best, as good as the one that beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics. </seg>
<seg id="2890"> However, my favourite was the one in the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and gave the US team a beating, which was quite similar to the time we won bronze at the World Cup. </seg>
<seg id="2891"> That team not only again included Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and 'Piculín' (Ortiz), but also the young (Javier) 'Toñito' Colón and James Carter, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quijote' Morales, who was kept out of the 90 team by a knee injury. </seg>
<seg id="2892"> A team that maybe was not the best in terms of members, but which gave us a gold medal and was a great joy to work with, was the 1995 Pre-Olympic team in Neuquen, Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="2893"> With role players such as 'Canito' Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended after the shambles of the Mar del Plata Pan-American Games, we won gold against all the odds. </seg>
<seg id="2894"> Who was the best Puerto Rican player? </seg>
<seg id="2895"> Without any doubt, Piculín Ortiz. </seg>
<seg id="2896"> His numbers at international tournament level are awesome. </seg>
<seg id="2897"> Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculín did. </seg>
<seg id="2898"> Not to mention his career in the various leagues he played in. </seg>
<seg id="2899"> Who was the best Puerto Rican manager? </seg>
<seg id="2900"> That's a difficult one. </seg>
<seg id="2901"> We had a very good team, including Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. </seg>
<seg id="2902"> Of the youngsters, I really like the work of Leo Arill. </seg>
<seg id="2903"> What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation? </seg>
<seg id="2904"> Having been part of the National Team's most glorious era between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season. </seg>
<seg id="2905"> What was there left for you to do? </seg>
<seg id="2906"> There were things I'd have liked to implement, such as regionalising the minor leagues. </seg>
<seg id="2907"> For example, the boys of Ponce only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs. </seg>
<seg id="2908"> Right now the kids are riding and playing too much, unnecessarily. </seg>
<seg id="2909"> At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and a course for leaders, table officials and referees. </seg>
<seg id="2910"> That pleases me. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> What are you doing now? </seg>
<seg id="2912"> The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos from my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Elizabeth, who has always been with me. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> Actor Larry Hagman dies </seg>
<seg id="2915"> Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Worth (Texas), became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "JR," in the television series "Dallas," in which he played a ruthless, malicious and manipulative businessman. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon predator JR Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died. </seg>
<seg id="2917"> He was 81. </seg>
<seg id="2918"> Hagman, who returned this year as JR in a new season of "Dallas," died on Friday afternoon of cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to the Associated Press by the Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas." </seg>
<seg id="2919"> "Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again representing the iconic role he most liked" the family said. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving Day holiday. </seg>
<seg id="2921"> Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> He brought joy to all who knew him. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him dearly. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> "He was an original guy and lived life to the full" said Gray in a statement. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years. </seg>
<seg id="2926"> In 1995 a malignant tumour as found in his liver and he underwent a transplant. </seg>
<seg id="2927"> Years before "Dallas," Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970. </seg>
<seg id="2928"> He played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive genie, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live with him. </seg>
<seg id="2929"> He also starred in two sitcoms that were not aired for long, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973). </seg>
<seg id="2930"> His film work included roles well received by critics in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors." </seg>
<seg id="2931"> But it was his masterful interpretation of delightfully detestable JR that led to Hagman reaching his peak of stardom. </seg>
<seg id="2932"> The drama series on CBS about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991. </seg>
<seg id="2933"> The tagline "Who shot JR?," designed to generate hype around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is nearly killed, generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars wagered in gaming establishments. </seg>
<seg id="2934"> It also helped give the series a record audience at the time. </seg>
<seg id="2935"> When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment programme in history, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers. </seg>
<seg id="2936"> It was JR's sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him. </seg>
<seg id="2937"> JR got her pregnant then threatened to say she was a prostitute unless she left town, but there were others who also had reasons to attack him. </seg>
<seg id="2938"> Hagman portrayed Ewing as a corrupt insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and cheating husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), sectioned. </seg>
<seg id="2939"> "I know what I want on JR's tombstone" Hagman said in 1988. </seg>
<seg id="2940"> It should read: "Here lies the honest citizen JR Ewing." </seg>
<seg id="2941"> This is the only deal he lost. </seg>
<seg id="2942"> Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, on and off screen." </seg>
<seg id="2943"> He is unforgettable and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each one of us who was fortunate enough to know and love him. </seg>
<seg id="2944"> Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for TNT. </seg>
<seg id="2945"> He had already finished recording five episodes for the second series and a sixth was in process, the chain reported. </seg>
<seg id="2946"> Immediately after, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would handle the loss of Hagman. </seg>
<seg id="2947"> Hagman, born in Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan." </seg>
<seg id="2948"> Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman. </seg>
<seg id="2949"> He tried his luck in the New York theatre scene in the early '50s, and later served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956, in England. </seg>
<seg id="2950"> While there, he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her. </seg>
<seg id="2951"> The couple had two sons, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city Malibu, home to many celebrities. </seg>
<seg id="2952"> In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales About My Life." </seg>
<seg id="2953"> "I didn't put anything in it that I believed would hurt anyone or affect them in any way" he told Associated Press at the time. </seg>
<seg id="2954"> After his liver transplant, he became an organ donation promoter and worked as a volunteer at a hospital, helping fearful patients. </seg>
<seg id="2955"> "I advise them, encourage them, meet with them when they come for their surgery, and afterwards" he said in 1996. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> I try to offer some comfort, such as "Don't be afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but then you'll be fine." </seg>
<seg id="2957"> He was also an anti-smoking activist and took part in several campaigns. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> Start of a course that explores the "End of the World" </seg>
<seg id="2959"> Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> This term, when Professor of religion, Stuart Charmé, decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew he had a compelling hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar, 21 December, which had convinced many people that the end of the world was coming. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> But Charmé had no idea what awaited him over the next couple of months: The cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice some called "debt Armageddon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, where end-of-the-world Christians theorists think the Apocalypse will begin. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> "I didn't realise this was going to be the most apocalyptic term ever" said Charmé this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey). </seg>
<seg id="2963"> If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this term, theoretically the last in history. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> At Temple, Associate Professor Barry Vacker is giving the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world." </seg>
<seg id="2967"> Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> "We looked at why these ideas proliferate over time" he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide human behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> This month students analysed movies with an apocalyptic theme and explored how they compare with real-life examples. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> "I've tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible" said Vacker. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> At the main Pennsylvania State University campus, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall, and his colleague Amara Solari, an Associate Art History and Anthropology Professor, have teamed up to give a course, called simply "The end of the world." </seg>
<seg id="2973"> "We don't add '2012' so we always have the option of running the course again, if the world doesn't come to an end" said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2974"> Despite the "impending doom," students have to study, undertake projects and take final exams. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very night the world is supposed to end" said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> The courses proved quite popular. </seg>
<seg id="2977"> "It was fully booked within two hours" said Restall, on his course for students with high averages, which was filled with 35 students. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the term, from people asking if there were any places. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> Students, meanwhile, say the course is one of the most interesting around. </seg>
<seg id="2980"> "I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves" said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old post-graduate Religion and Sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden. </seg>
<seg id="2981"> And the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is just a matter consolation or a lack of it. </seg>
<seg id="2982"> Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old post-graduate Psychology and Nursing student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> "I'd never heard of a class that could teach it" he said. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> I enjoy it. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> But none of the students interviewed - much less any professor - said they believed in the end date of December 21st. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> "Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy and to a certain extent we discredited it" said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old final year student at Temple, from West Chester. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> The Mayans never predicted the end of the world: it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall. </seg>
<seg id="2988"> But he said that Western culture suffers from apocalyptic anxiety, which goes back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="2989"> The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations. </seg>
<seg id="2990"> "In other places, people don't think about it" he said. </seg>
<seg id="2991"> It's mostly in the English-speaking world. </seg>
<seg id="2992"> Joseph Dougherty, a Professor of religion at La Salle University, who is giving courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any courses on the "end of the world" there. </seg>
<seg id="2993"> "The Philippines are not taking part in the end of the world" he wrote, suggesting an exception of a higher authority. </seg>
<seg id="2994"> We have an indulgence from the Pope. </seg>
<seg id="2995"> Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last judgement, and said that if nothing happens on December 21st, "people will immediately start thinking of the next date" or philosophising that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end. </seg>
<seg id="2996"> Students and teachers are taking the date lightly. </seg>
<seg id="2997"> Some said they plan to go to "end of the world" parties. </seg>
<seg id="2998"> "Maybe I'll call some friends so we can have a laugh together" said Samira Ford, 20-year-old communications student. </seg>
