<seg id="1631"> the meeting on tuesday between president obama and the leaders of the congress expressed no breakthrough in the big questions, with the one during the &apos; lame duck &apos;, the meeting at the end of a period in which no decisions will be taken, has had to employ session pyramid.. </seg>
<seg id="1632"> after all, it has not been a discussion between two different sides, nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan punktesammelns courtly listening to, what we are. </seg>
<seg id="1633"> the public meetings of the defizitkommission of the president on wednesday, was also in a civilised, despite the political differences between the members continue to exist. </seg>
<seg id="1634"> it seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months, a mutual respect, the ideological divide that continues to support the members divides them, the emergence of leaves. </seg>
<seg id="1635"> this is hardly enough to claim that it is a new era of cooperation to make their voice heard. </seg>
<seg id="1636"> both sides are now in a test phase-in of the one of the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while trying to define the limits of the public opinion and the patience of voters after a re-weigh themselves to demand it. </seg>
<seg id="1637"> therefore, were at the meeting on tuesday, himself, and his assessment by the participants on a minimum level of demands or accusations of limited. </seg>
<seg id="1638"> the philosophical differences between obama and the republicans are too big and too deep, a rapid change in the atmosphere, which in the past two years, was, one might expect it as that. </seg>
<seg id="1639"> regardless of whether it is a matter of taxes, donations, health or benefits, that is the two sides are walk for miles away from each other. </seg>
<seg id="1640"> last but not least, the novemberwahl washington, at least for a short time mild. </seg>
<seg id="1641"> &quot;there is no question that the tone has changed,&quot; said pete wehner, an official representative of the bush administration, the now for the &quot;ethics and public policy center&quot; is working. </seg>
<seg id="1642"> &quot;this is after elections inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="1643"> elections give partisan passions, the once again feel. </seg>
<seg id="1644"> and that is a good thing. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="1645"> in a number of issues, particularly in those that are on the agenda of the &apos; lame duck have both republicans and democrats, hardly any other choice than to find a solution, &quot;are session.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="1646"> bush&apos;s tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no-one is in favour of this. </seg>
<seg id="1647"> both sides want to find a way to some, or even all, to receive, whether it is temporarily or permanently. </seg>

<seg id="1649"> after the meeting on tuesday at the white house is the optimism has risen, that these issues during the &apos; lame duck &apos; some and, at the same time, the new start treaty, cannot ratify session in one. </seg>
<seg id="1650"> but william glaston of brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of lame duck &apos; does not necessarily to a lasting cooperation between the parties, if the new congress in january, to be convened. twelve must lead session. </seg>
<seg id="1651"> instead, he says, is in a phase of the more likely, perhaps even inevitable. </seg>
<seg id="1652"> &quot;after the things that need to be done, and done, this will be short-term psychology in confrontation,&quot; said erupt into him. </seg>
<seg id="1653"> wehner is also sceptical of this-and this scepticism is shared by many-the courtesy to real cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="1654"> &quot;i see a lot of what is happening, as, or shadow-boxing show, for the main event of 2012 &apos;, he said with until today to 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1655"> the reasons for this have a great deal of work with the new republican majority in the white house to do so, and with the teeparty-voters, the presentation of their education, are conducive to goods. </seg>
<seg id="1656"> how concerned the republican leaders may be, that they are too high, you know that you have to try to live up to their promises, the expenditure of the government and to reduce the health reform to be repealed, vie to comply with this, too. </seg>

<seg id="1658"> the deputy chairman alan simpson and bowles have one of the most difficult jobs in washington and have, in accordance with their own assessment, so much so that the defizitfrage on the public agenda, that that they will no longer be ignored, can be pushed to erskine. </seg>
<seg id="1659"> but they need within the commission fourteen of the eighteen votes in order to ensure that its plan for the official recommendation to make, and they are fighting very, in order to also only in the vicinity of these numbers to come. </seg>
<seg id="1660"> the biggest opposition, the elected representatives of the people of the body, as in finance, at least today, little room for manoeuvre, or little sympathy for compromises is in place is. </seg>
<seg id="1661"> galston says two stages in the fight between the white house and the republicans in congress. </seg>
<seg id="1662"> the first fight will be next year, in the form of take place, if the republicans, obama in terms of the budget, taxes and the health system to challenge, later followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="1663"> what will this change? </seg>
<seg id="1664"> the public opinion. </seg>
<seg id="1665"> it is a proven fact that, in spite of the partisanship of the current election, the majority of americans are still hopes that the two parties to work together. </seg>
<seg id="1666"> if confrontation in a blind alley, as it happened, then both parties must have a careful look at the public reaction 1995 respect. </seg>
<seg id="1667"> whoever is on the losing will change tack and the compromise must seek, will be sentenced. </seg>
<seg id="1668"> this may, in fact, an optimistic view. </seg>
<seg id="1669"> partisanship and polarization are greater now than it was in the middle, and they seem to have a greater ideological gap between obama and the congress-republicans to be between president bill clinton and the republicans at the time as years of 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="1670"> at the same time, to see the activists from both parties 2010 as a prelude to a much broader election result in pure 2012. </seg>
<seg id="1671"> so it may be a matter of courtesy, this week will be borne by many americans, to be welcomed. </seg>
<seg id="1672"> but it will be on both sides very much more effort to require a common denominator in the questions to find the two still separate. </seg>

<seg id="2053"> it was the first between germany (tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its european partners, including france. strict thought necessary, what the signs for the drifting apart. </seg>
<seg id="2054"> the second sign is a central european country, as mrs merkel, the decision to bail out greece, painful hinausschob the set. </seg>
<seg id="2055"> at that time, it was the much criticised, but the fact of the matter is that the political consensus in germany, the public and the published opinion is totally opposed to a bail-out of greece. </seg>
<seg id="2056"> merkel, in the last of a clear position it calls for a reform of the agreements concluded by the european union, in order to ensure the survival of a country, to enable and, at the same time, the private lender, to commit themselves to a part of the costs. with oktobertagen new is finally out. </seg>
<seg id="2057"> this position has been interpreted as anti-european, since they are the irlandkrise and everything the following advancing. </seg>
<seg id="2058"> but if there is also something that has been adopted. in the course of the next few months we will be involved in the reform of the european union, these measures from 2013 sweetened proposal, which is intended to enable her to participate. </seg>
<seg id="2059"> germany has a red line, which it does not have to exceed does. </seg>
<seg id="2060"> it says all that-even if we now unpopular measures must be taken, it is as of that date, the old way of the euro, will no longer be available. </seg>
<seg id="2061"> this will be a new currency zone, in which the countries will be forced to explain and, in this case, the private sector is a part of the costs. go bankrupt, is able to be punished, hard-geburtsjahr 2013 </seg>
<seg id="2062"> germany shows us that we need to take, with high levels of austerity and investitionsraten, moderation of the productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive the consumption, improving growth path in a tough external economic balances. </seg>
<seg id="2063"> the other alternative, the debt and the construction industry with huge holes in the balance of payments is based, as they at times of boom in order simply will not be tolerated, was cited by spain on. </seg>
<seg id="2064"> the offer is clear. </seg>
<seg id="2065"> and we would be wrong to do that, it is not easy to understand. </seg>
<seg id="2066"> it is not just a question of the government deficit by the end of year 2013 on three per cent runterzufahren. </seg>
<seg id="2067"> the demands are much harder. </seg>
<seg id="2068"> and the worst thing that we could do, under these conditions is ourselves to cheat. </seg>
<seg id="2069"> i hope that the current turbulence in more calm. </seg>
<seg id="2070"> and that we will have the opportunities, the us will be offered, until the spring 2013 will use. </seg>
<seg id="2071"> it seems that mr zapatero has taken this so well, and his announcement (of the promised reforms after the meeting i had with the large companies and the announcement of the new measures of yesterday) that, in spite of the criticism of merkel&apos;s hypothesis, his own house in order in to create, is their way of preparing, points out saturday at the last double has. </seg>
<seg id="2072"> but the german red line is there, and it does not seem to me that something would change in the somme. </seg>
<seg id="2073"> among the possibilities is the fact that we are the countries with little serious gestopften euro area fully to leave, should not be ruled out. what is considered. </seg>
<seg id="2074"> in this case, could germany would still have to say, it was warned us. </seg>
<seg id="2075"> sport and regelumgehung </seg>
<seg id="2076"> tricks, such as those of alonso and ramos in the game against the ajax show inventiveness, but not the will, a sanction to circumvent. </seg>
<seg id="2077"> of the two players of real madrid (xabi alonso and sergio ramos) exclusion in november against the ajax in the champions league, that a lot of ink has been spilled, whether it is or not, and whether, perhaps, both players of the uefa sanction should be acted on a unsportliche act in order to discuss this led 23 stake by the evidenced by supposedly the. </seg>
<seg id="2078"> as is well known, the two players, a couple of minutes before the team had won), time and several fouls, now that would ensure that the referee you the second yellow card showed played clearly (her post-match has already been lost. </seg>
<seg id="2079"> in this way, and as the real madrid his dignity, will be the two players the mandatory penalty at the next ligaspiel against the auxerre without so much as a set of cards in the next spielphase and meet cite group on the aeroplane. </seg>
<seg id="2080"> finally, the disziplinarkommitee of the uefa, the coach of the club, mourinho, with two to play and the parties involved players with different sums of penalising. </seg>
<seg id="2081"> the provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football. </seg>
<seg id="2082"> it is so widespread that they form part of the ethos of the unwritten, but in this game, which is rules-is. </seg>
<seg id="2083"> part of the debate about the case is that a team of football clubs real madrid (which, in its national anthem and honour and on other occasions, his players for similar incidents punished had played, and at the dramatisierung by mourinho, the more to its long history, as theatralischer and provocative technicians has added to an episode which was a key player in the purports to be blocked, described going back that have arisen. </seg>
<seg id="2084"> in any case, the debate about whether this does not refer specifically to the statutes of the principles of the sport, that is to say, whether these actions a regelumgehung actually believes this approach to the statutes of the sport, but it does not seem to make sense to circumvent. represent goes against type of prohibited is revolves. </seg>
<seg id="2085"> in this matter, should the sporting spirit caused damage to be investigated. </seg>
<seg id="2086"> the sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, one aspect of the matter, which, by means of these actions is not threatened, because it was not to be an aggressive game. </seg>
<seg id="2087"> a further aspect of a clean game is to avoid that, the players an unjustified benefits from the gegenteam. this, too, was not -. </seg>
<seg id="2088"> the paradox of the action of the players of the real madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally under falschspiel or regelumgehung understand, because the rule was not secretly, in order to be a sanction to be avoided, but it should be so striking as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee made the purposes of circumvention. </seg>
<seg id="2089"> the players waited and took the sanction joyfully. </seg>
<seg id="2090"> another question is what kind of advantage the-from the deliberate fouls went. </seg>
<seg id="2091"> here, it should be emphasised that the rival either in a less favourable situation brought benefits for the game because the obvious result of this action was that the own team with less players discussing without anybody, erheischt were played was still had to. </seg>
<seg id="2092"> it is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club has not then on this players. </seg>
<seg id="2093"> the benefit is that the players the next spielphase the champions league without maps, their participation in a future game could threaten, obviously, to start. </seg>
<seg id="2094"> but it is a long-term that, to a certain extent, uncertain, given that the team could. in this way, a sanction and go in the second kartenzyklus on, in which they with a card less than in the first cycle because players also receive the retirement at some point also benefit retirement. </seg>
<seg id="2095"> so it is not so clear, whether it is really an advantage. </seg>
<seg id="2096"> ultimately, such practices are not opposed to the sporting spirit, which is also strategic decisions are, in order, from the rules to derive maximum benefit is directed. </seg>
<seg id="2097"> in this case, wanted to keep the players do not sanction deal (that would be, in fact, a clear case of regelumgehung), they wanted more choice, and when you look at this. </seg>
<seg id="2098"> they met a strategic decision, without a penalty saved, or before her to flee. </seg>
<seg id="2099"> although the border between intuition and regelumgebung is, i believe, that it is in this matter in order to have a clear case of intuition is blurred. </seg>
<seg id="2100"> i have the impression that the controversy as a result of two factors: because it has to do with two was, and because of the nature of the ordinary public whom is created. </seg>
<seg id="2101"> the damage to the principles of the sport by these acts is less ethical rather than aesthetic, that has been inflicted on nature. </seg>

<seg id="2910"> but we are going in the right order. </seg>
<seg id="2911"> the first aspect is the confirmation of the fact that it is difficult to carry out any of a secret service file (a nation) exclusively from press cuttings of any x-produced by wikileaks of composed. </seg>
<seg id="2912"> the &quot;extraordinary&quot;, american revelations about the sexual habits of berlusconi&apos;s throw, nothing more than what we are about in each of the journal to read (except those whose owners), and the terrifying karikaturierte profile gaddafi&apos;s bot already for a long time for their sketche. substance is berlusconi was any x-anyway, months after. </seg>
<seg id="2913"> the rule, according to the the already well-known news, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and this is not only in the course of this century must be from secret dossiers only. </seg>
<seg id="2914"> if you are in a library esotherischen publications will be that each of the grail, the mystery of rennes-le-chateau, the templer or the rosenkreuzler) exactly the repeated, to what is already enshrined in previous works has been written about, you see, is dedicated to the work (go. </seg>
<seg id="2915"> this is not alone, therefore, that the author of occult texts do not publish (still, therefore, that he not, where news on the non-existent), but because those who are the okkultismus to believe what you already know and confirmed what they already have learned the nothing other than to devote to, would be to find knew wants to research. </seg>
<seg id="2916"> this is also the erfolgsmechanismus of dan brown. </seg>

<seg id="2918"> the informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited intellect) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could, for example, editor in), the only true, what he considered to be something which is also increasingly recognises. </seg>
<seg id="2919"> the top-secret information about mr berlusconi, the american embassy in rome the staatsdezernat had, were the same as those who newsweek already sent the week before, was published. </seg>
<seg id="2920"> so why was such a fuss about the revelations of these dossiers made? </seg>
<seg id="2921"> on one side of each person, and that the messages-at least since the end of the second world war, and since then, too, the heads of state or government of each other or a plane, in order to function, with the exception of some small classed in spionagezentren have turned, and have lost their diplomatic meeting-dinner can take to be able, while already know what state this, well-educated. </seg>
<seg id="2922"> viewers of ermittlungsfilmen knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy, this is the way to do this is to ignore any number of each. </seg>
<seg id="2923"> nevertheless, the fact that it publicly, to repeat, the task of the hypocrisy and serves to protect the american diplomacy in a bad light, to be violated. </seg>
<seg id="2924"> the idea that a hackers the secrets of the most powerful country in the world, carries with it the significant blow against the prestige of the staatsdezernats can tap geheimsten x-random: to second place. </seg>
<seg id="2925"> in addition, the scandal is less the victims, rather than the &apos; executioner &quot;in trouble. </seg>

<seg id="2931"> how can, however, be a power, which is no longer in its own secrets to maintain? </seg>
<seg id="2932"> it is true, has already said that a real secret is a mystery is (and a secret can never be); it is also true, however, that any knowledge about the nature of berlusconi&apos;s or, in fact, a secret, unfettered by geheimis is, since it is the public sphere; but in the wikileaks secrets of hillary clinton empty secrets were, means that they are of any power to deprive the, that of vintage publishing summaries merkel reveals an empty empty simmel georg. </seg>

<seg id="2953"> the eu has billions of euros over three years, promised france 1.26 billions of euros (d. h. million per year). there 2 seventh, </seg>

<seg id="2955"> the operation is transparent and for their actual value estimated: the developing countries and the civil society, if all the developed countries have the same on the same like to see it come is remarkable. </seg>
<seg id="2956"> the eu announced that in the years eur two billion released to have, what you are on the right path to respektbezollung their commitment of seven, two billion in 2012 brings, 2010. </seg>
<seg id="2957"> but if we have to go into detail about looks, things are a little more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="2958"> according to the copenhagen treaty and, in addition, in order to ensure that an additional use has been tabled, without, to the detriment of public development aid to be &apos; new &apos; should this money be. </seg>
<seg id="2959"> unfortunately, there is no consensus on what to do, &quot;new and additional&quot; means. </seg>
<seg id="2960"> while the eu commission, a harmonisation of certain member states, including france, have proposed that the procedure has been blocked. </seg>
<seg id="2961"> choosing today everyone the benchmark, the he, as the best thing to do. </seg>
<seg id="2962"> the eu commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of the year: the international finance will be maintained, and within the framework of funding &apos; almost-start &apos; on for three years, is selected as the 2009 150m to do so. </seg>
<seg id="2963"> other countries have similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or about conditions at the level of public development aid will be elected. </seg>
<seg id="2964"> france was of the opinion that the funding &apos; of all new projects, &quot;the year 2010 were&quot; new and additional &quot;to do this in return. </seg>
<seg id="2965"> in other words: there is no benchmarks in the expenditure of the year or at the global level, public development aid to the previous one. </seg>
<seg id="2966"> can the sum total of the french support for the developing countries remain stable (or decrease) - france, his commitment with regard to the &apos; new and additional funding to comply with &quot;before there is said to be concrete. </seg>
<seg id="2967"> another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans. </seg>
<seg id="2968"> there is still no rule, and every elects its rechenmodus. </seg>
<seg id="2969"> some, such as, for example, france, are 1 borrowed being as equivalent to being donated. </seg>
<seg id="2970"> obviously, this is difficult to acceptable: the trouble is not comparable. </seg>
<seg id="2971"> if the use of loans for certain profitable investment (often to the projects, the technology is based) can be justified, it is deceptive, the euro has to be known as the equivalent of a euro... only the cost of the loan for the kapitalgeberland as a commitment to be counted (d. h. the equivalent of an interest rate). should the theft donated, and, in addition, to actually present at tied. </seg>
<seg id="2972"> but france has in mind, as the following consideration: it &apos; respect &apos; its commitment of millions of euros, five percent loans (389, eight million euros) and eight and a half percent donates) one million euros) - see also the eu document to convince themselves that 36, by 91 there different nothing. </seg>

<seg id="2974"> germany, denmark, the netherlands, or in the case of slovakia (among other things) to their obligations to one hundred percent with donations, while six percent. </seg>
<seg id="2975"> in other words, if the vast majority of the european union to fulfil their obligations are france just ten cents and understands including a comparable, spends use. </seg>
<seg id="2976"> beautiful hokuspokus! </seg>
<seg id="2977"> all in all, the absence of france in his almost-start-up financing with a double: to a part of the action on the time and, on the other part of the reality of the financial commitment weiterentwicklkung with a rip-off. </seg>
<seg id="2978"> france will succeed in it, that millions of &quot;new and additional&quot; million in accordance with its promise has spent and saves it 36.1 millions of euro. there to believe. </seg>
<seg id="2979"> the manipulation of the finance ministry (as seems to be that it was, has carried out a double negative effect once (why other member states with the donations continuing, if it?) and then, in the negotiations, given that the developing countries are not completely deceived... to borrow, however, is enough to make the drive-internally eu; could the arbitration of bercy probably it) </seg>
<seg id="2980"> the chapter of the funding is only a small issue on a relatively short period of time, compared to the whole of the discussions on the climate began. </seg>

<seg id="2982"> we hope that this will not be the case. </seg>
<seg id="2983"> as always, it is absolutely vital that his lesson to be learnt from this first year of premature funding was the also to learn. </seg>
<seg id="2984"> in the first instance france could be a change in his verbuchungsart 2011 and 2012 in a spirit of respect for its obligations and the justice with the other countries in the european union, balancing while, and announce the for years. </seg>
<seg id="2985"> above all, however, france could the discussions on the subject of a dispute with the long-term financing (another crucial issue): we can escape the question of the &apos; verrechenbarkeit &apos; or the verbuchungsart his loans not discussed at the moment and to bring forward. </seg>
<seg id="2986"> france could alter its position so that just ahead of the curve in terms of the disputes to be, as it is the other things. </seg>
<seg id="2987"> the hope is based, therefore, on the new environment minister kosciusko-morizet, the next week in will arrive. </seg>
