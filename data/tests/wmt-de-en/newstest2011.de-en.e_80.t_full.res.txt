<finished>: on the contrary , it is a new round in the difficult , process the redefining of the euro . 
<finished>: it is undermining germany a fundamental new perspective on shaping our future to maintaining the old traditions of bulk its partners . 
<finished>: ) given the resistance in europe begins in germany about three from the crisis find spekuliern ! 
<finished>: the first : a strong euro with germany , austria , the netherlands and other countries , whereas south leave the euro . 
<finished>: secondly : the reintroduction of the german mark , although currently rather science fiction , assisted by a large proportion of public opinion , around fifty per cent of the population .

<finished>: sport and regelumgehung 
<finished>: gimmicks as the alonso and ramos at stake , against the ajax , show inventiveness , but not the , a sanction . 
<finished>: alleged , of two players of real madrid ( xabi alonso and sergio ramos in the game of 23 november , against the ajax the champions league led to ink spilled whether a unsportliche and carrying whether any , both players of which uefa punished . " not act or , about camera , launched 
<finished>: as is well known , lost , the two gambler a few minutes to go ' ( her team had already acquired a time and fouls , now that would , for the referee a 's second yellow card showed . ) several ' ) , clearly flirted 
<finished>: in this way , and since the real madrid his group , could the two gambler the mandatory penalties at the next ligaspiel , against the auxerre , and as maps in , the next spielphase . , mention 
<finished>: disziplinarkommitee uefa the coach of the club , josé mourinho , with two , play and the participating gambler , with different sums of money . " the , a penalising 
<finished>: the provocation " a yellow card , given such or similar circumstances is a new , it is more often in the world of football . 
<finished>: it is so widespread that they form part of the ethos , - unwritten , but in this sport visible , rules . 
<finished>: , part of the debate about the case that a team of the club real madrid ( the anthem and honour and other occasions its players for similar incidents ) , and dramatisierung mourinho , a episode a more its long history as theatralischer " and provocative technician . " with flirted 's britain aggravates claimed blocked 's outlined encountered 
<finished>: , at any rate the debate about whether this does not refer specifically the statutes prohibited behaviour the principles of sport , contradicts which i mean whether they activities regelumgehung . , actually believes this about statutes of the sport , , seem but its meaning . a course around 
<finished>: , at this matter should 's sporting spirit ailment be investigated . 
<finished>: " of the sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of opponent , an aspect by this actions not at risk , it was no aggressive game . 
<finished>: , another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the - gambler an unjustified benefits from the gegenteam . , also did not happen . 
<finished>: the paradox of activity of players of real madrid is , not correspond to what we normally regard as falschspiel " or regelumgehung understand , because bypassing the rule , not secretly to liberate a sanction , but as possible from referee punished . conspicuous " 
<finished>: the players waited and arrested the sanction joyfully , 
<finished>: another issue is what kind 's advantage ! the , from the deliberate fouls - . 
<finished>: here should be emphasised that the rival , neither in a worse situation been benefits for the feigned a game erheischt , because the obvious result of this action was that the 's own a team , with less players discussing without anybody . 
<finished>: it is not beneficial strategy for the next because the club , has , then , on these players . 
<finished>: the benefit is obviously that players , the next spielphase of champions league 's without cards that its participation in a future a game could threaten circumstances . 
<finished>: but it is a long - term , to a certain degree advantage because team . moreover the players with this approach a sanction and go in as the second kartenzyklus , kartenanhäufung with a card , less than , in the first cycle . ' because a farewell at some point mice 
<finished>: that is not as clear , whether it is really an advantage . 
<finished>: , after this action not against the sporting spirit , strategic decisions to the provisions maximum benefits . , address 
<finished>: , in that case , wanted the players no sanction ( in would actually be a clear case of regelumgehung ) , they , wanted to vote , when they , this . , bypass 
<finished>: they took a strategic decision , without a penalty evade " or before her generalities . 
<finished>: , although the border between imagination and regelumgebung blurred is , i believe that this matter a clear , case of intuition . 
<finished>: i have the impression that the controversy as a result of two factors arose : because two selbstausschlüsse and because of the way the without regelübertragung ! 
<finished>: the damage caused the principles of sport by these actions inflicted is less ethical , rather than aesthetic .

<finished>: rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies 
<finished>: ! the rtbf wikileaks has a twofold . 
<finished>: on one side , it has a scandal , which is a scandal in sinner hypocrisy 's beziehunge between countries , the citizens and the press . turns apparent a scandal 
<finished>: , as the other side announces " they profound changes at international level , and gives a foretaste by recession dominated a future . 
<finished>: but we in the right order . 
<finished>: the first aspect of wikileaks is the confirmation of the fact that each of a secret service airline act ( any nation ) exclusively from press cuttings . 
<finished>: " exceptional " , , american revelations about the sexual mores anything more than what we are for months any journal , to read ( except , whose owners berlusconi is ) and this alarming karikaturierte gaddafi bot kabarettkünstlern long time agent , for her sketche ! a profile got , x anyhow , in any , as from berlusconi accuse 
<finished>: the rule , after which the hidden already consist is essential of the dynamism of the intelligence , and not only in this century . bringing news on - 
<finished>: if they are in a library esotherischen you will see ( the one on the grail , the mystery " of rennes - le - chateau " that templer ' or rosenkreuzler exactly repeated what already in previous factories . " ) , work every " , and publications the attention 
<finished>: this is not , alone , therefore , that the author occult texts never ( still not he would know where to news about the non - ) but because those who okkultismus nothing unlike the believe what you already know and confirmed what it already have learnt . " , and address itself 's , could exist , to find " , and also publish , can researches , accordingly 
<finished>: this is also the erfolgsmechanismus " of dan brown . 
<finished>: also the secret files " . 
<finished>: the informant is a bad ' and lazy ( or in limited intellect ) is also the head of the intelligence service ( could otherwise whatever , editor libération ) , the " only true , and what he . " as , as " he 
<finished>: the top secret , information on berlusconi , american embassy , in rome , asked those same as those newsweek , already week earlier was published . adeptly " the staatsdezernat 
<finished>: so why was a notice the revelations these dossiers ? 
<finished>: on one side , what each person has knows , and that the embassies , at least since the end of the second world war and since then also the government leaders are mutually or an aeroplane may dinner - its diplomatic and have lost with the exception of some , small classed ' in spionagezentren . a function 's justice formed according 
<finished>: any viewer from ermittlungsfilmen knows this very closely , and it is not for hypocrisy , so doing it to ignore . 
<finished>: : the fact it publicly again , injured , the task of hypocrisy and helps american diplomacy in a bad light . , but 
<finished>: in second place : the idea that a business - usual hackers ! the geheimsten secrets most powerful country in the world phone ' can the considerable blow against the prestige & staatsdezernats ! , entails & 
<finished>: in addition , the scandal less the casualties , rather than the " , executioner " in trouble . 
<finished>: ' but we address unless , nature , of what happened . 
<finished>: former ' to orwell , times , it was all power , like a big brother pool each gesture , his subjects - controlled " . 
<finished>: orwell prophecy could completely correctly , it any move , thanks to the telephone can check , every transaction hotel the elected highway and so forth , the citizens would express its total casualty of eye 's power ! , visited made ! ' may as apparent 
<finished>: but if we , today , that even the secret krypten 's power do not control a hackers escape from , so does the kontrollgang , about to be directed , and are zirkelförmig ! - am , against 
<finished>: 's power every citizen , but everyone 's citizens , or at least the hacker avenger by many citizens - can the secrets of power in . " as acquired a controlled 
<finished>: how can , however , is no longer able , their own secrets , to ' ? 
<finished>: admittedly , georg simmel said that a real mystery an empty secret is ( and an empty mystery can never be unveiled ) ; it is also true that any informed about character berlusconi " or merkel basically a mystery , free of geheimis , because there is the public sphere surrenders ; but in wikileaks 's secrets hillary clinton secrets , have , means it on to power . as empty $ disclose of 
<finished>: wikileaks has neither sarkozy were still merkel , injustice , however clinton and obama . 
<finished>: what will the consequences of this snub , , a such huge ( power caused ? 
<finished>: it is obvious that the states in future , no reserved information , online - the would 's street corner angeklebten posting . ' 
<finished>: but it is also clear that the technology forgiveness is hoped confidential , reports on phone keep secret . 
<finished>: is nothing simpler than find out whether and when a head a aeroplane 's , and a his colleagues contacted ) . 
<finished>: how could , future , private , and only for certain ears , certain maintain relations ? 
<finished>: i know very well for my moment following science - fiction romanhaft sounds , but i am compelled me the regierungsagenten , in secretive way , and score and uncontrollable marschrouten warms their communications anywhere unlike in bare , and moreover , the few written information they have schuhabsatz verbergend ! varied viewpoints erase " " to discern " and " in forecasting 
<finished>: , the information in a single copy in locked drawers be stored : basically , the spionageversuch watergate less successful when wikileaks . $ 
<finished>: i had the opportunity to write the technology , nowadays , like a cancer , accelerating , , backwards . 
<finished>: a century after the wireless telegraf communicating revolutionised , asked reconstructed " the internet a telegrafen ( telephone " ) wire ! 
<finished>: the ( analogue ' ) cassettes had the filmforschern a band probe tottering spulen , all secrets of individuals while the ( numerical cds , nothing else considered from chapter to chapter , , in makroportionen ! , nowadays ' ) reveal assembling a forward , it , accusing band " for cinema 
<finished>: 's trains within three - hour from rome to milan , while by plane , including the switching half hours . continued 
<finished>: it is therefore not abnormally that politics and communications " on car and horse of return . 
<finished>: a final observation . 
<finished>: in earlier times the press , understand , for secrets between the embassies forged , 
<finished>: now the messages confidential information by the press . 
<finished>: climate - as france 's own finanzversprechen schönredet 
<finished>: a year after the copenhagen agreement is the time , adherence quickly dissolved financing pledge ( also " almost ' or premature ) to examine developing countries have been implemented . finance beginning 
<finished>: are already the rough , french schönredereien discovered . 
<finished>: with the copenhagen treaty developing countries , obliged thirty billion - dollar between 2010 and 2012 . 
<finished>: , the eu has eur 7.2 billion over three years , france 1.26 billion euros ( d . h . 420 million per year ) ! , promised 
<finished>: when opening the cop16 , the eu has been its partners from the fact almost start - finance detailgetreuer its member states , press conference , great nebenevents broschürenverteilung ! " , and vorgehensbericht score : , about its commitment , bore all 
<finished>: the operation , transparency is noteworthy and degrees , for their intrinsic value appreciated : the developing countries and the civil society would like to see all developed countries , the same on the same präzisionsniveau . 
<finished>: ) the eu announced , in 2010 2 billion , are released what her to the right path to respektbezollung its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012 . 
<finished>: but if we detail looking , are things are slightly more complicated . 
<finished>: this money should according to the copenhagen treaty ' new and additional ' , to ensure that an additional , deployment , without impairing 's public development aid . 
<finished>: , unfortunately there are no consensus on what ' new and additional ' means . 
<finished>: whereas the eu - commission a harmonisation had proposed certain member states , including france , the procedure blocked . 
<finished>: choosing today everyone benchmark in , best . 
<finished>: the eu commission has , for example a benchmark for those of 2009 ‘cohesion’ : the international finance are retained , and gives the funding of " almost - start ' on for three years , 150 million . 
<finished>: other countries have a similar benchmarks , either in respect year or , about conditions , level of public development aid elected . 
<finished>: in return , france was the opinion finance ' of all new projects " of 2010 ' new and additional " . 
<finished>: in other words : there is no benchmarks 's expenditure of previous year or at global level in public development aid . 
<finished>: specifically , can the amount , the french support developing countries remain stable ( or also decrease ) - france its obligation concerning ' new and additional " , finance . 
<finished>: , another , decisive element is the breakdown in donations and loans . 
<finished>: , about there is no rule , and everyone elects its rechenmodus ! 
<finished>: some , such as france for example , , 1 borrowed being as equivalent in donated being ! 
<finished>: this is apparently be difficult acceptable that the effort is not comparable " . 
<finished>: if the use of loans for certain profitable investment ( , often emissionseindämmung to projects to be justified , it is deceptive , the euro to present termed the equivalent , for a hijacked . also , only the cost of the loan 's kapitalgeberland ( d . h . the equivalent of an interest rate ' ) . counted " as ' commitment ' euro donated ' ) , technology are based actually benefiting 's 
<finished>: but france did nothing in a different sense than , the following comment : " ' his commitment of 420 million euro % 389 , eight million euros ) and 8.5 % donates 36.1 million euro ) - see eu document to convince themselves ! ' ) " ( , loans , . it , respected 
<finished>: france is the only country in the eu that loans in a great extent . 
<finished>: germany 0.46 % , while denmark , the netherlands or slovakia ( among other things ) : its commitment to 100 % by donations . 
<finished>: in other words , if the overwhelming majority 's european union 1€ to meet their commitments disbursed , gives france 10 cents and understands , including a comparable efforts . 
<finished>: fine hokuspokus ! 
<finished>: above all france his almost - start financing with a double cheating : a part , with an weiterentwicklkung action over time and partly from reality of financial support . breast 
<finished>: , france will succeed belief that there 420 million ' new and additional " , million in accordance with its , promises has spent and saves 36.1 million , all we eur . 
<finished>: the manipulation of the finance ministry ( da , it appears that it bercy , which carried a negative effect ; eu ( why 's other , if it is enough to borrow ? ) and then in the negotiations , as the developing countries not completely deceived . . by donations member states ' , travel , internally , twice ' ) arbitration 
<finished>: the chapter of premature finance just a small at relatively short time compared to the as discussions on the climate . 
<finished>: but it could the drop too far in 's immense machinery of the unfccc ! 
<finished>: , we hope this will not be the case . 
<finished>: as it , it is imperative , and its lesson from this first year of premature finance to learn . 
<finished>: ) primarily france could a change in verbuchungsart for the years 2011 and 2012 , and in a spirit of respect , for his commitments and the justice with the other countries of the european . countervailing announce 's 
<finished>: , but mainly france could the discussions about the a dispute of long - term finance forward ( an another topic ) : the question of verrechenbarkeit ' or verbuchungsart 's , loans , not . can escape " we also currently decisive and 
<finished>: france could alter its position so that – just advanced 's disputes , as the other is ! 
<finished>: a hope therefore on the new environment minister kosciusko - morizet next week in cancun . 
<finished>: a surprising announcement on the almost - start france and its vision ' verrechenbarkeit ' as well as the use of loans dignity of its nature , the international trust raise necessary for further discussions is !
