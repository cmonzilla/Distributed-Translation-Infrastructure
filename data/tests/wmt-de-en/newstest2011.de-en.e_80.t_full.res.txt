<finished>: and - it should be regularly turned . . 
<finished>: when they not enough entlüftungskanälchen in essence , and even on a firm prosaic lie , is congested humidity : so it is not excluded , that under its mould will . 
<finished>: in the election naturally plays a role , in of what we have grown accustomed . 
<finished>: anyone who , long time abroad , where very high mattresses ) with weichschicht customary will , a low matratze with hard surface used . difficult to 
<finished>: " it probably all eishockeyspieler from the nhl have returned , have complained to me that you are not longer right can sleep . "

<finished>: the army has so many zündschnüre , that we , quite the czech republic umwickeln it could but only two years 
<finished>: the czech army has 445 kilometres zündschnüre purchased , and with detonated bomb . . 
<finished>: the year before had the defense , already 224 kilometres zündschnur , to the armeelager supplied . 
<finished>: it is reassuring to know that the military forces for 225 , years ausgesorgt . 
<finished>: the only problem is the shelf - life of zündschnüre - two , but no more than four years . 
<finished>: the army bought " the zündschnüre , from the company stv group a . s . for läppische 40 million kronor . 
<finished>: in his justification for the purchase of this huge amount zündschnur replied the general staff mf dnes that the soldiers , would annually to the sixty kilometres zündschnur consume . 
<finished>: ' armeepyrotechnikern according to mf dnes that came from this claim that the whole army every year an extremely intensive training by all generals and officers ' armeekommandos , to the secretaries putzfrauen ' . should - pyrotechnical , to this 
<finished>: defence minister alexandr vondra and sponsored vlastimil picek no exception . 
<finished>: only in that way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres zündschnüren reasonably justify . 
<finished>: that long corresponds 25 . - thousand detonationen ' . 
<finished>: but even so , would these armeebestände for more than ten years rich . 
<finished>: but if neither the old rule of experts is that for the training of any new military professionals two metres zündschnur quite sufficient , then the army by these neueinkäufe - also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pioneer and special units - a reassuring stock for the already - mentioned 225 , years created . 
<finished>: , in soldiers schnelleinsatzbrigade recently from the defence minister vondra , they had almost no cartridges ' for small arms , more , so test firing at the lack of resources , because are greatly restricted . received 
<finished>: , dated unterhosenmangel not to remain silent . 
<finished>: " i is also not a , why by us such truckloads zündschnüre buy . " 
<finished>: but it is ultimately their decision , you will know to what they need . " 
<finished>: " for us , the army a good customer , where we as traders largely contrary to want to come , ' says the vertriebsmanager stv group jan děcký ! " 
<finished>: jan pejšek ) , the spokesman of the ministry establishes the shopping hundreds of kilometres zündschnur with the army had for at least ten years with this ' ammunition " , eingedeckt ' . as

<finished>: after the expiry of the gebrauchsdauer ) must any ammunition carefully will be tested whether they are reliable and not the lives of the soldiers at risk . 
<finished>: these tests but are not in vain , and a cost another money . 
<finished>: another argument of the defence ministry , the mengenrabatt 's 445 kilometres zündschnur ' . 
<finished>: " they , are sixty percent less than the last consignment of 244 kilometres ' , tells us spokesman pejšek the position of the department of defense . make procedures 
<finished>: only for the comparison : the annual consumption of zündschnüren ' of pyrotechnikern of the police , the ammunition from the second world war , or the soviet bruderarmee exceeds some years , hardly 1 500 metres . liquidate 
<finished>: and the police ordered , always only such quantities of these munitions it before the end of the gebrauchsdauer consume . 
<finished>: already the safety of pyrotechniker about , also considers so the opportunity to flexible purchases upgraded and thus also reliable zündschnüre open . 
<finished>: the ministry 's already huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the times of the warsaw treaty , as the zweihunderttausendköpfige czechoslovak people 's army on their campaign to the rhine - prepared ' . 
<finished>: " the pyrotechnikern according to mf dnes expected the czech armed forces in a few years , the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres age zündschnüre which you today as ' favourable " , purchased . she

<finished>: the atomic energy agency iaea has new indications on a secret nuclear programme in syria . 
<finished>: , the country protesting but to comment - still allows checks . 
<finished>: from the fifth to 6 september 2007 attack at least four israeli f - i fighter planes , a mysteriöses würfelförmiges buildings in syria . " , 15 , against midnight 
<finished>: it is on the shores of the euphrates , the next major city , thirty kilometres away , are dair as - saur ' . 
<finished>: her name disappears in documents of the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) to when it comes to the reactor , syria allegedly with help from north korea , in the quader built hidden in a valley by the electricity . 
<finished>: according to a briefing of the us auslandsgeheimdienstes cia from the end of april 2008 would be the also under the name of the near town el - kibar authentic reactor well suited , plutonium to produce - from a nuclear weapons build . 
<finished>: for other purposes against it achieves the technology , from the 1950s very little . 
<finished>: the cia conducted a videopräsentation with by means of fuzzy be ' . 
<finished>: by computeranimation blendete you , where the components of the reactor from destruction have been a verkleinerte copy of the north korean model , from the atomzentrum yongbyon . 
<finished>: additionally , it presented photographs , above the building , from near or even the innenraum ' . 
<finished>: the reactor , is just before the commissioning , said it , but not yet pellets peppers . 
<finished>: today , more than three years after the bombing , is little more known as at that time , the mystery with time , a greater . 
<finished>: the former us president george w. bush has recently in his memoirs revealed that the cia before the attack is fairly certain that syria in el - kibar one reactor built , but hardly evidence saw that the country ' an active nuclear ' . 
<finished>: certain geheimdienstler , in europe there are more cautious and speak only by a ' alleged reactor ' , even if they cia presentation for ' plausible " , . better 
<finished>: they lack hard evidence , as well as the iaea ' . 
<finished>: asked how safe he is , one reactor , a senior un diplomat in the summer , but only the iaea was " enough material to ask questions . " bluntly replied before 
<finished>: the rubble of of the alleged " , unused militärgebäudes " , managed the syrians , although hastily aside and planierten the terrain thorough . 
<finished>: in june 2008 , a iaea team under the former chief inspector olli heinonen ' in el - kibar traces of uranium from human was manufactured . , however found 
<finished>: additionally , received the iaea on a member state satellite pictures commercial service providers from the period immediately after the attack , " the more meaningful than the cia presented ' . should be 
<finished>: these , however , are recordings on the market not because the unknown entities - perhaps israel - it exclusively has purchased . 
<finished>: the iaea can therefore , their authenticity not independent scale killings . 
<finished>: syria has always asserted , never a secret nuclear programme farms or a reactor built . 
<finished>: the uranium come from the israeli weapons , declared damascus . 
<finished>: but the refuted the iaea after analysing the particles , a unlikely back . 
<finished>: since then refuses damascus to discuss - as well as on the satellite pictures ' . 
<finished>: , moreover , are a second inspection in el - kibar and access to the ruins of the zerbombten building . controllers 
<finished>: but also israel remains silent pugnaciously ' . 
<finished>: " we will never comment on ' , reaffirmed recently the at the time of the attack president premier ehud olmert the official position . 
<finished>: dragging the investigation of the case since june , and " is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority ' , as a high western diplomat at the headquarters of the iaea in vienna - finally , is a serious breach of the non - proliferation treaty in the room , the iaea . pours scorn 2008 inconclusive , as 
<finished>: as a key to progress in the enlightenment is the iaea apparently three other facilities " in functional connection " with the alleged reactor , should - and , unlike this still exist . 
<finished>: the inspectors have not yet disclosed , what installations it is , still function , you have or what they seem suspicious . have 
<finished>: according to the süddeutsche zeitung you the iaea internally as marj as - sultan , masyaf ' and iskandariayah called , again , which are derived from nearby cities . 
<finished>: the independent institute for science and international security in washington ( in isis ) has these places identified , and on , a structure masyaf tracked down , which is most likely to one of the suspects objects . be , among 
<finished>: it is possibly in or directly alongside a military base - exactly with this justification denied syria the iaea access to the three places . 
<finished>: in vienna , it says the syrians feared ) a fishing expedition - that the iaea by the usa vorgeschickt will disappearance publicise ' . 
<finished>: as the nukleardetektive goods by a tip of the us intelligence services on the institutions . 
<finished>: the iaea has indications , including satellite photographs , that between the three places , and the quader , on euphrates material and has . 
<finished>: a high western diplomat in vienna , said that at least one of the installations could ' in connection with the fuel production ' . 
<finished>: there is but ' no indications of sensitive activities ' , i.e. uranium enrichment and reprocessing , and processes to the construction of nuclear weapons are necessary . 
<finished>: test the reactor will with uranium farms , not swelled . 
<finished>: but where the uranium , would have should come from and where consequent later the plutonium for bomb should be on these central questions there is nothing plausible guesswork . separated 
<finished>: unclear is whether rubble the valuable traces mountains in the three places stored . 
<finished>: as if the hundreds during which trailers of the disappeared , nobody wants to have information on where the debris . 
<finished>: only a few kilometres from el - kibar on the other side of the euphrates located salzmine al - tibni ' syria 1998 to their suitability , a camps for radioactive waste has investigated , the iaea as a unlikely . 
<finished>: the former iaea inspector robert kelley she had in a recent analysis of be , for the magazine jane 's intelligence review with the reactor at . renowned 
<finished>: recordings , from the orbit , show , however , that syria in the three suspects places erdarbeiten and large containers remote , after the iaea access requested . coincided 
<finished>: it can coincidence , but has little to the suspicion . 
<finished>: it says in diplomatic circles , have the iaea many months uses , a plan for inspections there to develop syria allow any militärgeheimnisse to preserve the effort shows how much interest the inspectors . alone , , should , furthermore 
<finished>: however , damascus bügelte also this proposal . 
<finished>: western diplomats in vienna before a year 's reactor was destroyed , so have the urgency about us ambassador glyn davies , since a few months so - called special inspections into the game , one of the harshest means the vienna atombehörde has controls . brings no appeased , had 
<finished>: iaea head yukiya amano of these inspections are proposing , has of a " option , for which i in the future open ' , but hesitates him . 
<finished>: there is a high risk in this way : on the one it needs for a majority in the governors of the iaea , and many of the represented 35 countries are anything other than eager for escalation . 
<finished>: on the other , as a diplomat are concerns : " what if they end up anything , find ? '

<finished>: the democracy movement in latin america is stronger , as support private companies . 
<finished>: crime is a bigger problem than unemployment . 
<finished>: in many parts of the region is the influence of brazil larger than that of the united states . 
<finished>: these findings came the latinobarómetro survey , in eighteen countries and exclusively in the economist has been published . 
<finished>: that survey since 1995 carried out regularly and shows the favour in this region . 
<finished>: two facts fall into this year 's poll of september and october , particularly in " s . 
<finished>: firstly , the good atmosphere in latin america 
<finished>: and secondly , the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions . 
<finished>: in many countries of the south american taken , the democratic movement increased greatly ( p . table 1 ) . 
<finished>: in peru z . b . , where the economy since 2002 annually by approximately 6 % is growing , the number of democracy from forty % in 2005 % this year . sixty 
<finished>: mexico , where the economy since the strong slump last year recovered , is one such trend to see . 
<finished>: but only half of the respondents in mexico and brazil , the most populous countries of the region , are firm democrats which the regional average reduces ( p . graph 2 ) . 
<finished>: approximately 44 % of respondents declared that you , with the democratic practice their country be satisfied . these are as many as last year , but 25 % more than in 2001 ( graph three ) . 
<finished>: about 34 % trust the congress of your country and 45 % of their government . , both those of the last year , show but a sharp increase from 2003 ( seventeen % or 24 % ) . limits 
<finished>: a decade 's initiative of latin america economic crises the efforts to more democracy . 
<finished>: it also during the great depression lasted , is that the countries of latin america only a brief recession experienced and quickly recovered . it 
<finished>: moreover , the poor through stronger safety net propped up ' . 
<finished>: ( according to reports of the un economic commission for latin america from this week rose 2009 the poverty rate in latin america only slightly and is again this year by 32 % . ) 
<finished>: but from country to country there are strong stimmungsunterschiede ( p . graph 4 ) . 
<finished>: brazil , strong economy and the popularity of outgoing president luiz inácio lula da silva reflects in a widespread fortschrittsdenken . 
<finished>: in mexico and central america , where the recession , more significantly , was and violent crime have increased , it is less the case . 
<finished>: only the second time since umfragebeginn , see many respondents in latin america during the crime in their country a greater problem than in the unemployment ( s . graph five ) . 
<finished>: approximately 31 % say that either they or a family member last year victim of a crime . but for 38 % last year are the values has fallen and achieve , therefore , the lowest since 1995 . 
<finished>: the rising economic performance is reflected in the increasing support for private and the market economy : approximately 71 % of respondents at cross - regional level said that the private sector for the development is essential in 2007 there were 56 % ( s . graph 6 ) . 
<finished>: approximately 58 % declared that only the market economy your country advance can bring , compared with 47 % last year . 
<finished>: interestingly 62 % of respondents in venezuela this view maintain ( and eighty percent are for a private sector ) , although their , hugo chávez , many private firms has been nationalised . left - winger , president 
<finished>: brazil has according nineteenth % of respondents ( 18 % last year ) the biggest weight in the region , followed by the united states ( nine % , unchanged since last year ) and venezuela ( 9 % compared with eleven % last year ) . 
<finished>: the respondents in mexico and most central american countries , however , see the usa is the most influential country , with this role in the dominican republic and nicaragua from venezuela will be accepted .

<finished>: on thursday , the attention persecuted process from steven j. hayes 's , three members a family from cheshire connecticut , killed , a formal end if the sentence about the death sentence , which the jury declared . " , was 
<finished>: , however hayes lawyers have already applications to court tabled , the reasons for an appeal and to the courts for years . - 
<finished>: a provozierendsten reasons is that it through intensive reporting on the process - including through the extensive use of order twitter durchschnittsreporter - to a ' zirkusatmosphäre ' and a as widespread , prompt penetration details , so that the jury in an improper manner by the public indignation influenced . overlapped must 
<finished>: this protest could the appelationsgerichte lead to deal with the issue , whether the new technologies , new rules in the courtroom will be necessary . 
<finished>: " as i during this process , i believe that it is really a threat is if the entry of the new technologies in the courtroom each individual 's right to a fair trial , " said thomas j . ullman - hayes as ' . " , influenced have experienced 
<finished>: the chairman of judges , jon c . blue by supreme kammergericht last week by ruling briefly and back when he said that the new media ' carefully controlled ' will , and that there is no proof that the jury of passions driven . the applications , said 
<finished>: but this was certainly not the final word in this matter . 
<finished>: for decades gerichtseinsprüche , noted that the reporting on notorious cases , doubts about the fairness of a process . 
<finished>: in his historic decision by 1966 , the supreme court of the united states the verdict against dr sam sheppard , a osteopaths , come from cleveland 's , his wife killed should have lifted and said in his decision that it because of the new media a ' karnevalsatmosphäre in the courtroom ' . 
<finished>: some believes that the kid , and the about " on the flight " on this crime is based . 
<finished>: , some lawyers , say gerichtseinsprüche , how hayes condemnation half a century later , the argument that new rules become necessary to ensure the communication channels , from the courtroom at the time of the fall dr sheppard unimaginable just to rules . - 
<finished>: " there is a good reason , about the influence of new media in processes by a broad public persecuted to be anxious , " said john j. donohue iii , professor at stanford law school , the death penalty in connecticut has investigated . his report will they arbitrarily imposed . 
<finished>: professor donohue , some appelationsgerichte could the idea fascinated be that the restriction a prompt communication from the courtroom emerging could the processes fair . 
<finished>: the ' twitter ' affair is only one of the many lawyers ' of - hayes explain to discuss and thus a condemnation . for years 
<finished>: the defenders claim , for example , that hayes , already cage could be as judge blue not to allow them , the reactions of potential juroren to test them during the jurorenauswahl appalling tatortfotos showed . by giving been - 
<finished>: a few of the juroren said , photographs of the victims , hawke ' - petit , 48 years , and their tüchter hayley , seventeen years , and michaela , 11 years , they would have with disgust . " , : 
<finished>: the defenders say that they would also the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution into question , and argue that the judge wrongly , a jury exchanged , a critic of the prosecutor 's office , and that he unacceptably pressure on the ruling would have constituted , when he saw the unusual decision had the jury over the weekend to freely . was 
<finished>: " the juroren were not isolated . 
<finished>: but their arguments on the influence of detailed reporting on the process is perhaps the greatest interest . 
<finished>: , in a urteilsanfechtung , which it last month , have tabled they noted that the case the news in connecticut dominated and had during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the american senate by the candidates debated . 
<finished>: " they argued that the new media , continuously the flames of the emotions on the case reopened . 
<finished>: " it is such a daily crush of medienpiepser cameras and reporters outside the gerichtssaals ' , lawyers , " even prior in new haven and perhaps even nationwide never seen . " has been signed " , 
<finished>: , your focus on the reporting by twitter is controversial . 
<finished>: in interviews , he said , some journalists , the assertion that these direct news are aufwieglerischer than reports , whose be reimbursed , a technikfeindlicher eye , the reporting on future processes verarme ' . 
<finished>: but some lawyers said , appelationsgerichte , would often with the argument faced , social and technological changes need " the adaptation through the courts . 
<finished>: - hayers lawyers accelerating this assertion . 
<finished>: , in her objection referred to the decision of the supreme court of 1966 , in which the condemnation of dr sheppard reporting been lifted and made it clear that the new media new rules require . a result of 
<finished>: " this case " , and so you also said , " represents sheppard , against maxwell of the twenty - first century . " 
<finished>: , can courtesy that which divides us ? 
<finished>: after a campaign at schimpfwörtern ' and negativity is this week 's , little courtesy in washington broke out ' . 
<finished>: it is the omen of a genuine zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion , before we quickly returned to the struggle of the parties in the capital is returning , then ? 
<finished>: the meeting on tuesday between president obama and ceos of congress produced no breakthrough in the big issues with which during the maelstrom . ' lame duck session ' , the meeting at the end of a period in which no decisions are taken , employ . 
<finished>: after all , what we hear , it was neither a courtly discussion between two sides a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern , but rather an empty episode , a partisan punktesammelns ' . 
<finished>: the public meeting of defizitkommission of the president on wednesday , has also civilised , despite the political differences between the members to continue . 
<finished>: it seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months a mutual respect arise , the ideological gap that continue to be members divides them . 
<finished>: this is hard enough to say there is a new era of cooperation arrived . 
<finished>: both sides are now in a testing phase - in of one of the other sign of cooperation and compromise while itself has sought , the borders of public opinion and the patience of voters after a re - parteienkriegsführung . calling 
<finished>: this was why the meeting on tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants on a minimum requirements or accusations limited . 
<finished>: the philosophical differences between obama and the republicans are too big and too deep , than a rapid change the atmosphere in the last two years reigned might hope . 
<finished>: whether in taxes , donations , health or benefits , the two sides are walk for miles apart . 
<finished>: lastly , the novemberwahl washington at least for a short time mild . 
<finished>: " no question , the tone has changed , " said pete wehner , a official representatives of the bush administration , now for the ' ethics and public policy center " , works . 
<finished>: " this is after elections inevitable . 
<finished>: election give partisan passions , which once destroys ' . 
<finished>: and that is a good thing . " 
<finished>: in some issues , particularly those that are on the agenda of the ' lame duck session ' , have republicans and democrats hardly any other choice than to find a solution . " 
<finished>: bush 's tax cuts end at the end of the year , and nobody advocates that . 
<finished>: both sides want to find a way for some , or even all to receive , be it temporary or permanent . 
<finished>: similarly , a compromise on the increased unemployment benefit expected if only because the republicans cannot afford , that believes , the soviet taxes for the rich , while they unemployed workers support . 
<finished>: after the meeting on tuesday in the white house is the optimism increased that we in these matters during the ' lame duck session " , a few , and at the same time the new start agreement ratify . 
<finished>: , however , william glaston brookings insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues concerning the lame duck ' not to a lasting cooperation of the parties must lead , if the new 112 . congress in january . session ' 
<finished>: instead , he says , is a phase of nichtübereinstimmens likely , perhaps even inevitable . 
<finished>: " it after the things that need to be done , done , will this short - term psychology to confrontation " , he said . turning 
<finished>: wehner also is sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many , the courtesy to real cooperation . 
<finished>: " i can see a lot of what from today until 2012 happening than with , or , shadowboxing , for the main event from 2012 ' , he said . 
<finished>: the reasons have much ) with the presentation of new republican majority in the white house to do and , with the teeparty ' voters their education conducive goods . 
<finished>: how concerned republican leaders also may be that they are high vie , you know that you must try their promises , the nicaraguan government and reduce the health reform to be repealed . 
<finished>: " this parteilinien are already in the first responses concerning the recommendations of the defizitkommission clearly what a tax reform , and raise taxes and increase the retirement age and reduce government spending . a 
<finished>: the deputy chairman alan simpson and erskine bowles have a of the most difficult jobs in washington and , in accordance with their own assessment , called for defizitfrage on public agenda that they no longer be ignored . 
<finished>: but they need within the commission fourteen of the eighteen voices , their plan to official recommendation on and they are fighting a very , also only in the near this number . 
<finished>: the biggest opposition is in the elected representatives of the body , because in finance , today at least , little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises . 
<finished>: galston says two stages in the fight between the white house and the republicans in congress . 
<finished>: the first , fight will next year in form of parteizusammenstößen place when republicans obama about the state budget , taxation and the health system , challenging later followed by a phase greater zweiparteilicher cooperation . 
<finished>: what will for this change ? 
<finished>: public opinion . 
<finished>: it is proven that , despite the partiality of the current election , the majority of americans still hopes that the two parties to work together . 
<finished>: " if confrontation is a blind alley , as it happened , and then both parties must carefully on public reaction . 1995 
<finished>: whoever they are losing condemned , will change tack and the compromise must seek . 
<finished>: this may , in fact an optimistic view . 
<finished>: partiality and polarization today are greater than in the middle of the 1990s , and they seem a greater ideological gap between obama and the congress republicans than at the time between president bill clinton , and the republicans ' . ' 
<finished>: the activists of both parties 2010 as pure prelude to be a consequence far broader choice 2012 . also witnessing 
<finished>: so may the courtesy , this week is supported by many americans be welcomed . for show 
<finished>: but it will be on both sides much more effort , require a common denominator in the questions , to find the two , still be separated .

<finished>: zapatero and the red line of germany 
<finished>: berlin has for the retaining of the euro decided , but , at the same time , conditions for the entire european union . 
<finished>: the tensions on the markets have a dual response of the administration . 
<finished>: on the one hand , josé luis rodríguez zapatero , new presented , starting with rebates for small and micro - enterprises , regulation of the agencies , or the lifting of 426 , euro assistance for unemployed people , the no unemployment benefit until the privatisation percent of aena , the management of airports barajas and el prat and thirty percent of the state lottery . of , adaptation measures 
<finished>: , on the other hand , supports the deputy head , elena salgado , with the help of former minister felipe gonzalez the criticism of the chancellor angela merkel as responsible , the current crisis herausbeschwört . 
<finished>: how are these transactions to understand ? 
<finished>: it is anticipated 's , merkel 's position , no mistakes of their relations . 
<finished>: on the contrary , it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro . 
<finished>: it is undermining germany a fundamentally new prospect for shaping our future , with the maintenance of the old traditions of most of its partners . 
<finished>: , given the resistance in europe begins people in germany , about three possible ways out of the crisis spekuliern ' . 
<finished>: the first : a strong euro with germany , austria , the netherlands and other countries , while the south to leave the euro . 
<finished>: second , the reintroduction of the german mark - although currently rather science fiction , supported by a large part of the public opinion , around fifty percent of population . , 
<finished>: the third : a transformation of the euro , according to german proposals . it means : more macro - economic supervision ; strict budgetary management ; punishment of the countries the requirements , and möglichereweise zahlungseinstellung of some countries , and the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures on the private sector . " the broken 
<finished>: the german position is clear and paints itself for some time . there is therefore now , no excuses . 
<finished>: first , 2009 , as both the imf as well as the european commission incentives for deficits and the german government , a constitutional reform , from the sleeves withdrew this 2016 . vessel 
<finished>: it was the first signs of the drifting apart between what germany , thought necessary ( in tax plans and stable public finances ) and the practices of its european partners , including france . a strict 
<finished>: the second demonstration , the central european country , as merkel the decision to rescue greece painful hinausschob ' . 
<finished>: at that time the strongly criticised . but the fact is that the political consensus in germany , the public and the published absolutely against a rescue of greece . 
<finished>: finally , merkel , in the last oktobertagen , with a clear position . it calls for a reform of the agreements of the european union , to the rescue of one country to allow the private lender , to oblige a part of the cost . , and at the same time new 
<finished>: this position was as anti - european interpreted as it irlandkrise and everything following advancing ' . 
<finished>: but your proposal , if somewhat sweetened was adopted . in the coming months , we will in the reform of the european union , which these measures from 2013 should enable participate . 
<finished>: germany has a red line , which it not to exceed . 
<finished>: it says all that - even if unpopular measures must be taken - it as of this date the old functioning of the euro will no longer be available . 
<finished>: 2013 , the geburtsjahr of a new currency for countries hard punished , be forced can explain and in this case the private sector a part of the cost . insolvent - 
<finished>: germany shows us that we a hard path ahead , with high saving and investitionsraten , moderation of consumption , improving the productivity and competitiveness and a positive external balances . 
<finished>: the alternative , on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments is based , as they of spain at times of boom in order was cited , will simply not be tolerated . 
<finished>: the offer is clear . 
<finished>: and we would be wrong to do that , it is not understood . 
<finished>: it is not just about the government deficit by the year 2013 on three percent runterzufahren ' . 
<finished>: the demands are . 
<finished>: and the worst , what we under these conditions could do is ourselves to cheat . 
<finished>: i hope that the current turbulence in more calm . 
<finished>: and that we opportunities that we be offered until spring 2013 take . 
<finished>: it seems that zapatero has taken this so well , and his double announcement ( the promised reforms , after the meeting with the big companies last saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday ) , indicates that , despite the criticism of merkel the hypothesis order in own house to concentrate on their way . 
<finished>: but , the germany somme red line is there and it does not seem that to change . 
<finished>: among the contemplating ways , that we with little serious , countries are fully gestopften euro area would have to abandon not carried out . 
<finished>: , in this case could germany , us still say it have been warned . 
<finished>: sport and regelumgehung 
<finished>: tricks like alonso and ramos , game against the ajax , show inventiveness , but not the will , a sanction . 
<finished>: alleged of two players of the real madrid ( xabi alonso and sergio ramos has instigated exclusion in the game november against the ajax the champions league led that much ink , been stymied whether it is a unsportliche act , or not and whether players by the uefa sanctioned should be . , possibly , both was about , by 
<finished>: as is well known , lost both players a few minutes to go ( in your team had already gained ) , time and played a number of fouls , now that would ensure that the referee , you second yellow card showed . a clear 
<finished>: in this way , and as the real madrid , his group , will be the two players the mandatory sanction next ligaspiel against the auxerre and maps in the next spielphase . without so 
<finished>: , finally penalising ' disziplinarkommitee uefa the coach of the club , josé mourinho , with two games and the parties players with different sums of money . 
<finished>: the provocation , a yellow card under such or similar circumstances , is not a new practice , it is more often in the world of football . 
<finished>: it is so widespread that they form part of the ethos , the unwritten , but in this sport lines followed rules - . 
<finished>: a part of the debate about the case that a team of the club real madrid ( the , in its anthem and honour and in other occasions its players for similar incidents in the major proponent , and on the dramatisierung mourinho a episode longer to its long history as theatralischer ' and provocative technicians added . ) through punished , had claims blocked back outlined encountered 
<finished>: , in any case revolves around the debate about whether this does not refer specifically to the statutes prohibited the principles of sport contradicts , i.e. , whether these activities regelumgehung . this approach at the statutes of the sport , seem but its meaning . , really considers behaviour 
<finished>: at this matter should the sporting spirit ailment be investigated . 
<finished>: " the sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent , an aspect that , through these actions not at risk , because it was not aggressive game . 
<finished>: another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the - players an unjustified benefits from the gegenteam . also , the was not done . 
<finished>: the paradox of activity of the players of the real madrid is that they are not correspond to what we normally , among falschspiel ' or regelumgehung understand , because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly to liberate a sanction to avoid but they should , as striking as possible from referee punished . 
<finished>: the players waited and arrested the sanction joyfully . 
<finished>: another question is what kind of advantage " the - , from the deliberate fouls . 
<finished>: here should be emphasised that the rival either in a worse situation was still benefits for the feigned game erheischt , because the obvious result of this action was that its own team with less players discussing without anybody . 
<finished>: it is also no useful strategy for the next game , because the club does not then about these players . 
<finished>: the advantage is obviously that players the next spielphase of champions league , without a cards that their participation in a future game threaten could begin . 
<finished>: but it is a long - term , to a certain degree uncertain advantage , since the team at some point . the players with this approach a sanction and go in the second kartenzyklus , in which they kartenanhäufung with a card fewer than in the first cycle . about also receive retirement 
<finished>: that is not so clear , whether it is really an advantage . 
<finished>: after this , not against the sporting spirit , which also strategic decisions , from the rules maximum benefit . address 
<finished>: , in this case , wanted the players no sanction circumvent ( the would actually be a clear case of regelumgehung ) , they wanted to vote , when this . 
<finished>: they took a strategic decision , without punishment sidestep or before her on generalities . 
<finished>: although the border between imagination and regelumgebung blurred is , i believe that this matter a clear case of intuition . 
<finished>: i have the impression that the controversy as a result of two factors created : because it comes to two selbstausschlüsse was , and because of the way the without regelübertragung ' . 
<finished>: the damage caused the principles of sport by these acts inflicted is less ethical rather than aesthetic nature . 
<finished>: angebotoffensive 's kundenfang for groups ' - weihnachtsabendessen in barcelona

<finished>: interpol gives a red warning for prosecution and capable of assange . 
<finished>: everything related to wikileaks and its founder , jullian assange , hydrocarbons , forms a complicated maze , in which the matters only difficult educate . 
<finished>: yesterday , interpol a ' red warning ' to ' detect and persecution " of assange . 
<finished>: it is , however , not a traditional order for the arrest . 
<finished>: in addition , it is not new , it comes from the twentieth of november . 
<finished>: it has also , nothing with the last revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the united states , but with the allegations of sexual abuse to which the australians , in sweden question .

<finished>: they also recall that assange the departure from sweden requested and the prosecutor , with the sagenumwobenen lavrentiy pavlovich beria " , head of security of stalin , then the permission . 
<finished>: " this is how a hunting , not as a legal persecution ' will , in the letter . 
<finished>: while the world is looking - and his mother of australia the innocence , their son affirms - believes assange in a unknown place , but not silent ' . , it 
<finished>: on monday he gave the head the magazine skype a vague from an interview . the conversation he questioned the resignation of the secretary of state of the united states , hillary clinton . time by

<finished>: puigcercós addiction with a nod , the carod close peace in the erc 
<finished>: " the republican leaders allowed the party a secret vote on be in office . 
<finished>: huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the vollversammlungsprinzips . 
<finished>: joan puigcercós seems a recipe to have found for umpteenth time an internal turmoil in the ranks of the after the loss of eleven members and the half of the votes richtungslosen erc from the path to go . 
<finished>: the chairman is aware that his threat of resignation close of former parteiführers josep lluís carod - rovira is not enough . but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is so weakened as your mentor itself and him not have the same headaches , as others former . will witness ' 
<finished>: therefore tried the leader of esquerra with a nod , the new critics what his position until the next municipal elections ensure dignity . 
<finished>: for the beginning kündete yesterday that the over two hundred of regional members of the council to erc about , his remain in office secret comment . 
<finished>: with ballot papers , not with gehobener hand . 
<finished>: although the carodisten ' präsidenen , a parking ticket , could you do this fear reprisals . wanted to 
<finished>: , in fact , would the head both the impression of division also subjection to his own person avoid . 
<finished>: in several interviews reaffirmed he , he would deal with the half of the votes plus a not feel confirmed , and he added without prozentwerten a result " in bulgarian style ' would also not good . , 
<finished>: " the carod close are demanding the president more than simply the party office available . an inadequate gesture , since puigcercós the supreme body of the congresses controlled . 
<finished>: but since they do not have a sufficient majority to enhance of resignations , are you with the chairman , a policy plan from now until may reconcile . 
<finished>: , for they expect , in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation responsibility on the eighteenth to the vote in the council will present to participate . 
<finished>: their intention is to puigcercós withdrawal . in return , these promises , and the congress in the autumn 2011 , in what the leader already granted for a fact . 
<finished>: the leader of the erc is of the view that the ' polyphonie " , a pity the stability and he seeks once and for all , the organisation in the situation to their dirty linen behind closed doors . 
<finished>: in this sense , the article , the president conseller josep huguet , in his blog sign symptomatic . 
<finished>: , given what puigcercós more than an ideologue , and holders of innovació it is a fact that the party leaders ' in exchange against various objectives ' based . felt 
<finished>: was five to , two of which the fore . 
<finished>: firstly , the ' restructuring ' of the board so that this at least ninety percent of party members , that is to say the inclusion of new faces ' from carods environment . 
<finished>: the second could a great news . 
<finished>: huguet proposes erc the vollversammlungsprinzip , a functioning , finally abandon . 
<finished>: , hence verfechtet it a reform of the statutes that allow is the congresses with elected delegates to hold .

<finished>: 's theoretical scheme , this is the sum , which the calvinist then would enable on the markets a part of the amount on her double . 
<finished>: today it is , finally , first projections from . 
<finished>: " the amending of 2010 , this morning , of the financial commission of the national assembly , contains the planned measures to make the first part of this money . looked 
<finished>: it is double measures : the creation of a special tax 's erschließund and higher taxation of offices at the ile de france .

<finished>: how much it would activities ? 
<finished>: a mystery . 
<finished>: this amount is not in the text . 
<finished>: of four billion , it is far away . 
<finished>: " it is that the fiscal resources four billion of the kapitaldotation added by the state , and the société du grand paris to and after for the project be done ' , the explanatory exposition . be found 
<finished>: , in the calvinist we find that this system is absolutely not offensive " . 
<finished>: " since the moment in which you income chalked ( the both taxes , d . r . ) , can we on three years blankets and only then , from the four billion , ' it will . possessed studies 
<finished>: " this is the budget noted and after and after deducted . ' 
<finished>: " the calvinist estimates that 2013 begun , the four billion for the budget 2014 taken note of your remarks . 
<finished>: this measure , its 4 promised billion , we still long will seek , quite a distraction , parliamentary debate , cause it . 
<finished>: the first public sitting will take place on december . 
<finished>: rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies 
<finished>: " the rtbf wikileaks has a twofold significance . 
<finished>: on one side , it has obvious scandal turns , a scandal that only a scandal in sinner hypocrisy is the beziehunge between states , the citizens and the press talks . 
<finished>: at the other side announces ) you profound changes at international level , and gives a foretaste by recession dominated future . 
<finished>: but are we set . 
<finished>: the first aspect of wikileaks is the confirmation of the fact that each of a secret service produced acts ( one x - any nation ) exclusively from press cuttings . 
<finished>: " the extraordinary ' , american revelations about the sexual habits berlusconi 's throw nothing further than what we are for months each x journal to read ( except those whose owners berlusconi is ) and this appalling karikaturierte profile gaddafi 's bot kabarettkünstlern long time substance , for their sketche ' . got any anyway , 
<finished>: the rule , after the secret dossiers only from already known news , there is essential for the dynamism of the secret services , and not only in this century . 
<finished>: if they are in a library the esotherischen publications , they will realise that every plant ( the one on the grail , the mystery of rennes - le - chateau ' templer , or the rosenkreuzler ) , exactly the repeated what already in previous works written . ' pays 
<finished>: this is not alone , therefore , that the author occult texts , no publish ( still , therefore , that he not would know where to news about the non - existing to ) , but because those who oppose the okkultismus , unlike the believe what you already know and confirmed what they already have learnt . nothing researches , wants to 
<finished>: this is also the erfolgsmechanismus ' of dan brown . 
<finished>: also the secret files ' . 
<finished>: the informant is a bad ' , and lazy ( or limited spirit ) is also the head of the intelligence service ( he could whatever , for example , among libération ) , which only true considers , what he recognise . editor , otherwise 
<finished>: the top secret information about berlusconi , the american embassy in rome ' staatsdezernat sent those same as those who newsweek already the week before that was published . , 
<finished>: so why was such a notice the revelations these dossiers made ? 
<finished>: on one side of this , what each individual already knows , which is that the messages - at least since the end of the second world war and since then also the government leaders mutually cannot or a plane can take to dinner - its diplomatic function and have lost , with the exception of some small classed , and in spionagezentren transformed . for phoning educated state 
<finished>: any viewer from ermittlungsfilmen knows this very well , and it is not for hypocrisy that doing it to ignore . 
<finished>: nevertheless , , the fact it publicly to repeat , injured the task of hypocrisy and serves to the american diplomacy in a bad light . 
<finished>: in second place , the idea that a x - usual hackers " the geheimsten secrets ' of the most powerful country in the world , can the significant blow against the prestige staatsdezernats ' . ' the tap runs 
<finished>: in addition , the scandal less the victims , rather than " the executioner " in trouble . 
<finished>: ' but dedicating ourselves to the depth in nature of what happened . 
<finished>: former , at orwell times , it was all power as a big brother pool any gesture of his subjects controlled ' . 
<finished>: orwell 's prophecy would completely correctly , where any move thanks to the telephone can control , every transaction 's hotel , the elected motorway and so on ; the citizens would express its total victims of the eye of power , visited made may be since , as 
<finished>: but if we bearing in mind what today is that even the secret krypten of power no longer the control of a hackers escape , so does the kontrollgang , one - sided to be directed , and will zirkelförmig ' . 
<finished>: power controlled every citizen , but everyone citizens , or at least the hacker , a avenger by many of the citizen - can the secrets of power in experience . choosing 
<finished>: how can but a power that is no longer able , their own secrets to become true , then ? 
<finished>: it is true , georg simmel have already said that a real secret an empty secret is ( and an empty secret can never be unveiled ) ; it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of berlusconi 's , and merkel is basically a secret free of geheimis , because there is the public sphere surrenders ; but in the wikileaks , for the hillary clinton empty secrets , means they any power . secrets ' from disclose of 
<finished>: wikileaks has neither sarkozy were still merkel injustice done , as opposed to clinton and obama . 
<finished>: what will the consequences this affront to be a so enormous accounts caused ? 
<finished>: it is obvious that the states in future any reserved information online will ask - and this would , in the street corner angeklebten posting of guilt . 
<finished>: but it is also clear that , with the current technologies , in vain to hope for is confidential reports on telephone keep secret . 
<finished>: nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state in a plane 's and a his colleagues contacted . 
<finished>: how could , in future private and only for certain ears , certain relations ? 
<finished>: i know very well that my prediction at the moment , after science fiction ' and romanhaft sounds but i am compelled me the regierungsagenten on secret fashion score and uncontrollable marschrouten warms their communications nowhere else than in the mere memory , with varied viewpoints and , moreover , the few written information , which you receive , in schuhabsatz verbergend ' . " to present 
<finished>: information would in single copy in locked drawers stored : basically had the spionageversuch ' of watergate less successful , when wikileaks . 
<finished>: i had the opportunity to write that the technology nowadays as a cancer progresses , and that is backwards . 
<finished>: a century after the wireless telegraf communication revolutionised , reconstructed the internet , a telegrafen ( telephone ) , wire ' . 
<finished>: the ( analogue ) , cassettes had the filmforschern allows a film bond ' for probe , by forward spulen and all the secrets of individuals while the ( numerical ) , cds nowadays , nothing else possible . as from chapter to chapter jumping , i.e. in makroportionen ' . installation reveal possession of band 
<finished>: , with the high - speed trains continued within three hours by rome to milan , while this by plane including the switching - half hours requires . 
<finished>: it is therefore not exceptional that politics and communications technology , according to car and horse return . 
<finished>: a final observation . 
<finished>: in earlier times tried the press to understand for secrets between the embassies forged . 
<finished>: today , it has the embassies , the confidential information from the press . 
<finished>: climate : how france to amend its finanzversprechen schönredet 
<finished>: a year after the copenhagen treaty is it takes time , compliance with the rapidly dissolved financing pledge ( also " almost start ' or premature funding to investigate by the developing countries have been implemented . ) 
<finished>: are already the rough french schönredereien discovered . 
<finished>: with the copenhagen treaty developing countries committed to thirty billion dollars between 2010 and 2012 . 
<finished>: the eu has 7 , two billion euros over three years promised , france 1.26 billion euros ( d . h . 420 million per year ) . 
<finished>: on the occasion of the opening of the cop16 the eu has all out its partners from the fact about the almost - start - score : detailgetreuer vorgehensbericht its member states , press conference , large nebenevents " , broschürenverteilung ' . funding of their commitment 
<finished>: the operation transparency is remarkable and degrees for their intrinsic value estimated : the developing countries and the civil society would like to see all developed countries have the same on the same präzisionsniveau . 
<finished>: , the eu announced that in the year , two billion euros released what it on the right path to respektbezollung their commitment of seven billion in 2012 . 
<finished>: but if we detail looks things are a little more complicated . 
<finished>: this money should according to the copenhagen treaty ' new and add " in order to ensure that an additional commitment has been tabled , without impairing its public development aid . 
<finished>: unfortunately , there are no consensus on what ' new and additional ' means . 
<finished>: while the eu - commission harmonisation had proposed , have certain member states , including france , the procedure blocked . 
<finished>: choosing today everyone has the benchmark he as on the best . 
<finished>: the eu commission has , for example , a benchmark for those of the year : the international finance are retained , and gives the funding of fast - start ' on three years 150 million . 2009 ‘cohesion’ 
<finished>: other countries have similar benchmarks , either in respect year or about conditions at a level of public development aid elected . 
<finished>: in return , france was of the opinion that the funding ' of all new projects " of 2010 are ' new and additional " . 
<finished>: in other words : there is no benchmarks , in the expenditure of the previous year or at global level of public development aid . 
<finished>: said specifically can the sum total of the french support of the developing countries remain stable ( or also decrease ) - france its commitment with regard to the ' new and additional " , finance . 
<finished>: another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans . 
<finished>: there is as yet no rule , and everyone elects its rechenmodus ' . 
<finished>: some , such as france , are 1 borrowed being as equivalent with donated being ' . 
<finished>: this is apparently difficult defensible that the effort , is not comparable . 
<finished>: if the use of loans for certain profitable investment ( frequently , to the emissionseindämmung projects on technology , are based ) , can be justified , it is deceptive the euro to be known as the equivalent of a hijacked . should only the cost of the loan , for the kapitalgeberland , a commitment of ( d . h . the equivalent of an interest rate ) . counted . moreover donated a euro present actually occurred 
<finished>: but france has nothing in a different sense than the following consideration : it ' respect ' its commitment of 420 million euro , by five percent loans ( in 389 , eight million euros ) and 8.5 % donates ) , 36.1 million euro ) - see also the eu document , to convince themselves ' . 91 
<finished>: france is the only country in the eu that loans to a great extent . 
<finished>: germany 46 % , while denmark , the netherlands or slovakia ( among other things ) : their obligations to one hundred % with donations . 
<finished>: in other words , if the vast majority , the european union 1€ to meet their commitments , spends , france , just ten - cent and understands including a comparable efforts . 
<finished>: fine hokuspokus ! 
<finished>: all in all , operates france in his almost - start financing with a double sham : a part , with an weiterentwicklkung the action over time and partly with the reality of financial support . 
<finished>: france , will succeed to believe , that it ' new and additional " , millions in accordance with its promise has spent and saves 36.1 million euro . , in 420 million 
<finished>: the manipulation of the finance ministry ( da it appears that it bercy , which has carried out ) , could be a negative effect ; eu internally ( why all the other member states , the donations if it is enough to borrow ? ) and then in the negotiations , as the developing countries might not completely deceived . . continuing drive twice arbitration 
<finished>: the chapter of the premature funding only a small issue at relatively short time compared to the entirety in discussions about the climate . 
<finished>: but it could the drop too far in the huge machinery of the unfccc . 
<finished>: we hope that this would not be the case . 
<finished>: as the matter , it is imperative , his lesson from this first year of premature funding to learn . 
<finished>: at first and foremost france could a change , in his verbuchungsart for the years 2011 and announce , in the spirit of respect for its commitments , and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the european union . 2012 
<finished>: but above all france could the discussions about the subject of a dispute of long - term funding forward ( another , decisive and currently discussed subject ) , : you can escape the question of verrechenbarkeit ' or the verbuchungsart 's loans are not . 
<finished>: france could alter its position , about , progressive about the disputes , as in other things . 
<finished>: the hope therefore on the new environment minister kosciusko - morizet , the next week in cancun . 
<finished>: a surprising announcement on the almost - start of france and its vision of ' verrechenbarkeit ' as well as the use of loan would by nature international trust raise necessary for secondary debates . 
<finished>: alarm of children held pesticides

<finished>: in july had a study by the european food safety authority ( efsa ) on the presence of residues of 365 of various in fruit and vegetables identified pesticides identified in europe are consumed , including 76 ' in cereals .
