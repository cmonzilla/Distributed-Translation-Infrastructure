\subsection*{Introduction}

This is a project made as a test exercise for automated machine translation which is aiming at automated translation of text in different languages.

For machine translation it is important to estimate and compare the fluency of different possible translation outputs for the same source (i.\+e., foreign) sentence. This is commonly achieved by using a language model, which measures the probability of a string (which is commonly a sentence). Since entire sentences are unlikely to occur more than once, this is often approximated by using sliding windows of words (n-\/grams) occurring in some training data.

\subsubsection*{Background}

An {\itshape n-\/gram} refers to a continuous sequence of n tokens. For instance, given the following sentence\+: our neighbor , who moved in recently , came by . If n = 3, then the possible n-\/grams of this sentence include\+: {\ttfamily  \char`\"{}our neighbor ,\char`\"{} \char`\"{}neighbor , who\char`\"{} \char`\"{}, who moved\char`\"{} ... \char`\"{}, came by\char`\"{} \char`\"{}came by .\char`\"{} }

Note that punctuation marks such as comma and full stop are treated just like any ‘real’ word and that all words are lowercased.

\subsubsection*{References and Decisions}

The first paper discusses optimal Trie structures for storing the learned text corpus and the second indicates that using {\itshape std\+::unordered\+\_\+map} of C++ delivers one of the best time and space performances, compared to other data structures, when using for Trie implementations

\subsection*{Project structure}

This is a Netbeans 8.\+0.\+2 project, and its\textquotesingle{} top-\/level structure is as follows\+:

\begin{quote}
./doc/ ./inc/ ./src/ ./nbproject/ ./\+L\+I\+C\+E\+N\+S\+E ./\+Makefile ./\+R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.md \end{quote}


Further, we give a few explanations of the structure above


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[}Project-\/\+Folder\mbox{]}/
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item doc/ -\/ contains the project documents, including the task text and the used papers
\item inc/ -\/ stores the C++ header files used in the implementation
\item src/ -\/ stores the C++ source files used in the implementation

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Open the console
\item Navigate to the project folder
\item Run {\itshape \char`\"{}make all\char`\"{}}
\item The binary will be generated and placed into {\itshape ./dist/\+Release/\mbox{[}platform\mbox{]}/} folder
\item The name of the executable is {\itshape automated-\/translation-\/tries}
