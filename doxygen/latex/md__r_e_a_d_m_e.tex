\subsection*{Introduction}

This is a fork project from the Automated-\/\+Translation-\/\+Tries project, made as a test exercise for automated machine translation (aiming at automated translation of text in different languages).

For machine translation it is important to estimate and compare the fluency of different possible translation outputs for the same source (i.\+e., foreign) sentence. This is commonly achieved by using a language model, which measures the probability of a string (which is commonly a sentence). Since entire sentences are unlikely to occur more than once, this is often approximated by using sliding windows of words (n-\/grams) occurring in some training data.

\subsubsection*{Background}

An {\itshape n-\/gram} refers to a continuous sequence of n tokens. For instance, given the following sentence\+: our neighbor , who moved in recently , came by . If n = 3, then the possible n-\/grams of this sentence include\+: {\ttfamily  \char`\"{}our neighbor ,\char`\"{} \char`\"{}neighbor , who\char`\"{} \char`\"{}, who moved\char`\"{} ... \char`\"{}, came by\char`\"{} \char`\"{}came by .\char`\"{} }

Note that punctuation marks such as comma and full stop are treated just like any ‘real’ word and that all words are lowercased.

\subsubsection*{References and Decisions}

This project is originally based on two papers\+: \begin{quote}

The first paper discusses optimal Trie structures for storing the learned text corpus and the second indicates that using {\itshape std\+::unordered\+\_\+map} of C++ delivers one of the best time and space performances, compared to other data structures, when using for Trie implementations

\subsection*{Project structure}

This is a Netbeans 8.\+0.\+2 project, and its\textquotesingle{} top-\/level structure is as follows\+:

\begin{quote}
./docs/ ./inc/ ./src/ ./nbproject/ ./doxygen/ ./test-\/data/ ./\+L\+I\+C\+E\+N\+S\+E ./\+Makefile ./\+R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.md ./\+Doxyfile ./make\+\_\+centos.sh ./make\+\_\+debug\+\_\+centos.sh ./make\+\_\+profile\+\_\+centos.sh ./make\+\_\+release\+\_\+centos.sh \end{quote}


Further, we give a few explanations of the structure above


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{[}Project-\/\+Folder\mbox{]}/
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item doc/ -\/ contains the project-\/related documents
\item inc/ -\/ stores the C++ header files used in the implementation
\item src/ -\/ stores the C++ source files used in the implementation
\item nbproject/ -\/ stores the Netbeans project data, such as makefiles
\item doxygen/ -\/ stores the Doxygen-\/generated code documentation
\item test-\/data/ -\/ stores the test-\/related data such as test models and query intput files, as well as the experimental results.
\item L\+I\+C\+E\+N\+S\+E -\/ the code license (G\+P\+L 2.\+0)
\item Makefile -\/ the Makefile used to build the project
\item \hyperlink{_r_e_a_d_m_e_8md}{R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md} -\/ this document
\item Doxyfile -\/ the Doxygen configuration file
\item make\+\_\+centos.\+sh -\/ the script to build all available configurations on the Centos platform
\item make\+\_\+debug\+\_\+centos.\+sh -\/ the script to build debug configuration on the Centos platform
\item make\+\_\+profile\+\_\+centos.\+sh -\/ the script to profiling debug configuration on the Centos platform
\item make\+\_\+release\+\_\+centos.\+sh -\/ the script to release debug configuration on the Centos platform
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Supported platforms}

Currently this project supports two major platforms\+: Linux and Mac Os X. It has been successfully build and testd on\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $<$big$>$Centos 6.\+6 64-\/bit$<$/big$>$ -\/ Complete functionality.
\item $<$big$>$Ubuntu 15.\+04 64-\/bit$<$/big$>$ -\/ Complete functionality.
\item $<$big$>$Mac O\+S X Yosemite 10.\+10 64-\/bit$<$/big$>$ -\/ Limited by inability to collect memory-\/usage statistics.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Testing on 32-\/bit systems was not perfrormed.

\subsection*{Building the project}

Building this project requires gcc version 4.\+9.\+1 and higher. The project can be build in two ways\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item From the Netbeans environment by running Build in the I\+D\+E
\item From the Linux command-\/line console
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Open the console
\item Navigate to the project folder
\item Run {\itshape \char`\"{}make all\char`\"{}}
\item The binary will be generated and placed into {\itshape ./dist/\mbox{[}type\mbox{]}\+\_\+\mbox{[}platform\mbox{]}/} folder
\item The name of the executable is {\itshape back-\/off-\/language-\/model-\/smt}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

In order to clean the project from the command line run {\itshape \char`\"{}make clean\char`\"{}}.

For the sake of simplicity and speed building on Centos platform is also possible by using make\+\_\+$\ast$\+\_\+centos.sh scripts. There are four of suck scripts available\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item make\+\_\+debug\+\_\+centos.\+sh -\/ allows to build the debug configuration\+: ready to be used with valgrind and gdb.
\item make\+\_\+profile\+\_\+centos.\+sh -\/ allows to build the profiling configuration\+: ready to be used for gathering performance information for gprof\+: produce the gmon.\+out file.
\item make\+\_\+release\+\_\+centos.\+sh -\/ allows to build the release configuration\+: the version build for performance with platform specific optimiztions.
\item make\+\_\+centos.\+sh -\/ allows to build all the above confgurations at once.
\end{DoxyItemize}

One can limit the debug-\/level printing of the code by changing the value of the {\itshape L\+O\+G\+E\+R\+\_\+\+M\+A\+X\+\_\+\+L\+E\+V\+E\+L} constant in the {\itshape ./inc/\+Configuration.hpp}. The possible range of values, with increasing logging level is\+: E\+R\+R\+O\+R, W\+A\+R\+N\+I\+N\+G, U\+S\+A\+G\+E, R\+E\+S\+U\+L\+T, I\+N\+F\+O, I\+N\+F\+O1, I\+N\+F\+O2, I\+N\+F\+O3, D\+E\+B\+U\+G, D\+E\+B\+U\+G1, D\+E\+B\+U\+G2, D\+E\+B\+U\+G3, D\+E\+B\+U\+G4. It is also possible to vary the information level output by the program during its execution by specifying the command line flag, see the next section.
