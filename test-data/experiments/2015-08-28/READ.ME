Runnig memory usage and model loading time experiments.
Note the OWL is not yet optimised much in the direction
of loading times. This is yet to be profiled and improved.
Moreover, the memory efficiency of OWL comes from just smart
memory usage without any special things like using float
compressions or other low level compression styles.
So the memory structures of OWL are currently not
compressed and are very explicit.
